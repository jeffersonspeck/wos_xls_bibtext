  abstract={ Abstract This study aims to evaluate Portuguese primary school children multiple intelligences. The participants were 112 children from public Portuguese schools, aged from six to ten years old, 61% male. The instrument used was the Portuguese adaptation of Laura Candler Multiple Intelligence Survey for Kids. After translation and retro translation, the scale was applied to the children, individually or in small groups. The results show that visuospatial, kinesthetic, naturalistic and interpersonal are the intelligences with higher values. There are no differences between gender except on linguistic-verbal and musical intelligences, with the girls presenting higher values. Data show the existence of all intelligences proposed by Howard Gardner, with variations among the children. },

  abstract={ This article argues for an approach to the assessment of students' translation assignments that is informed by the theory of multiple intelligences proposed by Howard Gardner in 1983 and expanded in his later work. This approach is based on two main strategies: (i) diversity of forms of assessment, offering learners the opportunity to have their performance assessed in ways which are compatible with their more developed intelligences, and (ii) interaction and negotiation between not only teacher and learners, but also among peers, to allow for the interchange that different proposed meanings and solutions require. It is now being tested in the undergraduate translator training program at the Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and the preliminary results indicate that it may successfully help develop and assess students' different intellectual potentials. },

  abstract={ Accepted widely by psychologists and educators and applied in a variety of ways in educational fields, the theory of multiple intelligences proposes a different understanding of intelligence. Howard Gardner has defined intelligence as the capacity to solve problems or to fashion products that are valued in one or more cultural settings. Based on his definition of intelligence, Gardner has described various intelligences through which individuals learn and teach information. The theory of multiple intelligences has strong implications for Christian education. This paper has attempted to provide a brief review of multiple intelligences connected with Gardner’s theory and its implications for Christian teaching and the learning process. },

The main objective of this study was to identify the multiple intelligences that predominate in education students of a Peruvian university. A non-experimental research with a simple descriptive design was carried out with a probabilistic sample of 234 students enrolled in the 2020 - I semester, to whom the MINDS Multiple Intelligences Scale by Ruiz (2004) was applied. It was concluded that the predominant multiple intelligences in the students are interpersonal, naturalistic and intrapersonal. In addition, it was found that in mathematical-logical intelligence the low level of achievement predominates in a significant percentage of students (61.1%), while in the other intelligences the medium level of achievement predominates in most students. },

The approach of this study was quantitative-qualitative, with an experimental design. For this, a training workshop on multiple intelligences was proposed and applied, as a learning strategy, to a seventh grade Physical Education teacher in a private institution in the city of Quito, implementing this knowledge in parallel A classes as an experimental group. In the evaluation, it was observed that there is a better level of learning in this experimental group, compared to the control group. As a conclusion, it should be noted that Physical Education teachers should include multiple intelligences as a learning strategy in planning and evaluations due to the improvement in educational processes. This proposal allows cooperative work, integration and inclusion, in addition, it favors the rhythm and way of learning of students through the execution of cognitive, social, affective and motor activities. These intelligences improve learning and generate in students the autonomy of physical activity for life, in practice. },

  abstract={ The new music curriculum in Korea contains “music in real life”. Students get to have the opportunity and a chance to enjoy fully the joy of music via a subject, music itself. To achieve the main objective and task of music class, each music class should offer students many opportunities to take part in the class actively and voluntarily. Howard Gardner suggests that each individual manifests varying levels of different intelligences, and thus each person has a unique cognitive profile. He claimed that the multiple intelligences work independently. According to him, the eight different intelligences that everyone is born with should compensate each other and developed simultaneously when people should work on to solve a certain problem. Therefore, I would like to combine the multiple intelligences of H. Gardner and music education. It will help students to take music classes actively with positive attitude and firm confidence. Various teaching and learning strategies with the theory are expected; First, the objective of music class will be easily accessible by using strong intelligences. Secondly, weak intelligences will be developed by doing musical activities related to the multiple intelligences. Thirdly, the musical intelligence will get stronger through various musical experiences with the multiple intelligences. Lastly, from the energetic musical impressions as a part of school life, students can enjoy music and their interest in music will grow in their lives. },

  abstract={ In his book, Five Minds for the Future (2006), Howard Gardner offers both a constructive critique of current educational practices and an alternative vision for the future of education. Gardner, best known for his seminal work on multiple intelligences, grounds his major conclusions primarily on the results of his impressive, decade-long, and massive Good Works Project. Despite my several agreements and significant overlap with Howard Gardner, I believe that there is insufficient evidence to accept fully his policy prescriptions. Gardner's selection of the five minds of the future - the disciplined, synthesizing, creating, respectful, and ethical minds - is based on a set of limiting assumptions concerning globalization, good work, individuality, power and control, disciplines as value-free enterprises, ethics as the point of view of the universe, and the completeness of his list. This paper suggests that our conception of education might be dramatically expanded to include a more critical and distanced stance towards: globalization, the current goals of business, individualism, the traditional disciplines, and even ethics than Gardner currently imagines. Its aims can and should be broadened to include not only good work, but also love and play. Students must learn how to control their environments, but also how to appreciate and accept life's inevitable difficulties and limits. Ethics should certainly play a more central role in education as Gardner correctly emphasizes, but our understanding of ethics must include not only respect but also care; not only principles but also dialog. To accomplish all of this, however, requires us to think beyond Gardner's five minds to include additional mental dispositions like the caring, critical, intersubjective, spiritual, and joyful minds. Each of these minds is explored in this paper. },

A questionnaire-type instrument was used to collect the data, which was validated and the reliability of which was 0.86. The Spearman correlation analysis showed a value of R=0,812 with a significance level p<0.05, indicating a very strong and significant positive relationship. On this basis it is concluded that MI is involved in the progress of the development of basic competencies in students, because multiple intelligences make a worthwhile contribution to the acquisition of the primary abilities of the students and is adaptable to any educational setting, at all academic levels. },

Multiple intelligences suggest that everyone has eight intelligences and shows different intelligence profiles. Strengths or weaknesses intelligence is manifested in a variety of ways, and each intelligence is influenced by each other. Multiple intelligences can manifest as excellent abilities and achievements by interacting within individuals or groups and combining them into different types. In this study, I will explore the basic structure and development of multiple intelligences, developing and demonstrating multiple intelligences through individual and group interaction, teaching-learning strategies using multiple intelligences, possibilities of additional intelligences and future direction of multiple intelligences. Based on the results of the research, discussions, conclusions, and suggestions were presented. Through this study, it will be possible to explore the possibility of applying the theory of multiple intelligences in the present age where diversity and creativity are emphasized. },

For the analysis we opted for the method suggested by Ginzburg (1989): the evidential paradigm. The data were collected by means of interviews and observations during the pedagogical interventions and showed signs that may have promoted learning disabilities in the school context. After the pedagogical intervention period, we concluded that motivation, discipline, interaction, self-esteem and expressiveness improved considerably.

For the theory of multiple intelligences, Dr. Howard Gardner asserted eight types of multiple intelligences under the presupposition the anyone had infinite ability. He analyzed and applied reading education by types of multiple intelligences and proposed a new program for the reading education aiming to evenly promote children’s various intelligences and heighten their creativities. The purpose of the new program is to have children throw away the idea that they should perfect their resultants in reading education time, develop their own strong intelligences through various experiences and processes and complement their lacking abilities. To prove the validity of the program I made FGI (Focus Group Interview) to the sample group consisting of child reading education experts. Analyzing the interview showed that the general idea of the group corresponded to the researcher’s expectation effect. I see that reading education has one-dimensionally developed significance if it enables all the children of the present and the future not to have the oppressive feeling that they should produce masterpieces in reading education but to take pleasure in the activities and improve their own abilities. },

His vision was widely supported by the educational community, which considers different forms of learning and accessing knowledge. Despite its impact, there is still a lack of development of tools that can easily, practically and reliably evaluate multiple intelligences. This work describes the design, development, and piloting of TOI (Tree of Intelligences) software, a digital tool to evaluate multiple intelligences and perform interventions through video games. The aim of the study is to present the design of the TOI software and test its operation, analysing the distribution of the results game by game and checking whether there are differences according to gender or school year. A total of 372 primary school students participated, aged 5 to 9 years old (M=7.04, SD=.871), from three schools in Asturias and Madrid. The results show that 9 out of 10 games had a normal distribution and that there were no gender differences in most games, but there were differences in relation to the school year. We concluded that due to its operation and design TOI software has the potential be a suitable instrument for the evaluation and intervention of multiple intelligences. },

From this theory, learning can be more complete if the different intelligence profiles of the students are considered instead of denying them or offering a teaching focused on one or two intelligences that may not be the most frequent in the group/class. The justification for using classroom activities and practices inspired by this theory lies in the complexity of the process of teaching/learning foreign languages, which requires the stimulation not only of intelligence, but of all intelligences in favor of a more complete and experiential learning. To promote the practical application of this theory, didactic keys are offered from the framework of each of the multiple intelligences. The article concludes with a recap on the relevance of including activities and practices in the ELEN classroom so that all children could learn in the way that is most effective for them, and that is present in a class that contemplates multiple intelligences. },

  abstract={ Over the past three decades, multiple intelligences(MI), proposed by Howard Gardner has drawn considerable attention from the researchers. According to Gardner’s classification, seven different types of intelligences are considered very important and each intelligence has an impact on the specific skill in language learning. This study investigates the multiple intelligences of Chinese speaking Korean learners by using MIDAS(Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scale). For this, the study employed MIDAS(Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scale). A questionnaires were administered to 178 Chinese students composed of 47 male students and 131 female students who enrolled in the Korean Language Institute of Yonsei University. As for the results, the study found out that : (1) Chinese Korean learners were high in Interpersonal Intelligence and low in Spatial Intelligence; (2) the Musical and Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligences show gender differeces - The mean score for the Female Chinese students’ musical intelligence was higher than that of male students’whereas male students’ bodily-kinesthetic intelligence mean score was higher than that of female students’; (3) the Multiple Intelligences shows no significant difference according to the proficiency in Korean. Limitations of this study are that not the same proportion of male and female students and also not the same proportion of proficiency groups. },

For the research, a Korean version(Ae-Yul Yu, 1994) of Children’s Playfulness Scale made by Barnett was used to measure the playfulness of a child, and Piaget/Parten scale was used for Social-Cognitive play. Moreover, a Korean version(Dae-Hyun Jung & Sung-Ae Chi, 2004) of the Multiple Intelligence Developmental Assessment Scale by Shearer was used to measure Multiple Intelligences. The data were analyzed with the SPSS computer program and Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient.The results were as follows：First, there was a close relationship between Multiple Intelligences and Playfulness. Playfulness without Manifest joy and Linguistic intelligence or Interpersonal intelligence. Second, Dramatic play, Parallel play, Group play, Solitary-Constructive play, Solitary-Games, Parallel-Constructive and Group-Dramatic were related with all intelligence domains of Multiple Intelligences in Social-Cognitive play. In conclusion, it would be desirable to provide children with play opportunities for the purpose of enhancing Multiple Intelligence. },

To achieve this, a sample of 321 first-year engineering students (107 females and 214 males) at a private university in northeast Mexico was analyzed during the 2020 academic year. Students were classified according to their gender, engineering program, and the development of their multiple intelligences according to Howard Gardner theory of multiple intelligences. To verify the effect of gender and program factors on the development of multiple intelligences, Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed with alpha = 0.05. The analysis of the effects of gender identified significant differences in four intelligences: linguistic and interpersonal (for which the female students obtained higher mean scores) and mathematical and visual (for which the male students obtained higher mean scores). The analysis of the effects of the engineering program identified significant differences in five intelligences: mathematical, visual, and musical (for which civil engineering students obtained a higher mean score than the students in the other programs); kinesthetic (for which computer science students obtained a lower mean score than students in the other programs); and naturalistic (for which sustainability engineering students obtained a higher mean score than students in the other programs). These differences allowed us to observe the characteristics of the students and to develop more inclusive courses in order to make the teaching and learning process more optimal and sustainable. },

  abstract={ The theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) states that human intelligence is composed of different types of intelligences and that each individual possesses all of them but to a different degree. The main objective of this research was to examine how the Theory of Multiple Intelligences was addressed in a seventh-grade Arabic-language textbook at the intermediate-level in Jordan and determine Arabic-language teachers' level of knowledge of applying the Theory of Multiple Intelligences in textbooks. The study used the survey method and analytical descriptive approach via content analysis and coding MI indicators in the textbook to examine the representation of MI in the textbook examined. The sample was composed of all units of a seventh-grade Arabic-language textbook. A questionnaire was distributed to 130 Arabic-language teachers. The study includes eight of the Intelligences from Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligences (MI) Theory. The analysis found that the intelligences represented in the texts, activities, and exercises of the Arabic-language textbook were mostly Verbal/ Linguistic, Visual/Spatial and Interpersonal intelligences, with a combined percentage of 73%. The other 27% was shared between the other intelligence types: Intrapersonal, Naturalist, Logical/Mathematical, Bodily/Kinesthetic, and Musical intelligences. A moderated awareness on how to incorporate the theory of MI in Arabic-language textbooks was found among Arabic-language teachers, which means that teachers' understanding of the importance of including MI theory in the textbook needs reinforcement and improvement. The study suggests that further research on incorporating the Theory of MI in textbooks is needed. },

Multiple intelligences theory reminds us that all children are not the same and can not learn in the same way. This is a scientific theory and educational philosophy that provides a framework and method for embracing even children who do not show strength in major subjects such as language and logic. In this study, I investigated domestic journals about the age of infants and elementary school students who have been most discussed and applied to the theory of multiple intelligences. For the purpose of the study, all 1,444 domestic journals were searched by the keyword ‘multiple intelligences’ from July 3 to 4, 2018. After that, I excluded those that are not related to this study including other subjects and fields. In addition, the items of each journal were sorted and classified from August to September, 2018. In this process, research contents and method of each journal were confirmed. The target of analysis was finalized with 108 cases for infants and 142 cases for elementary school students, total 250 cases. The data were quantitatively transformed after several examinations and statistical analysis was performed. As a result of the research, comprehensive analysis results of the multiple intelligences research are presented in two major ways. The first is the analysis result by item and the second is the analysis result between items. Based on the results of this study, the discussion, conclusions, and suggestions for future research were presented.

The way these multiple intelligences are combined differentiates us as humans, for example, in school, students react differently. Some students are more interested in learning, some are not. This may be due to different types of intelligence. Our research aims to highlight the dominant types of intelligence for second year students, depending on which teachers can adapt their teaching methods. The research was carried out over a period of 3 weeks. The participants in the research are 111 romanian students from National University of Physical Education and Sports, out of which 42 are female and 69 are male. The research methods used are: scientific documentation, questionnaire-based survey (multiple intelligences test was applied), statistical-mathematical method, graphical method. The results of the research provide us important data to see to what extent kinesthetic body intelligence is dominant in students practicing sports and what are the other types of intelligence present in athletes. Finding out the dominant types of student's intelligence can provide us important information according to which we can adapt our teaching methods. Thus, we can conduct our didactic activity in an attractive manner, in which the potential of students is not wasted and feel motivated to learn and evolve in a traditional classroom. },

  abstract={ Over the years, the multiple intelligences theory (MIT) proposed by Howard Gardner has renewed interest in learners' use of effective learning strategies and produced interesting results. This MIT-oriented study investigated the role of successful L2 readers' multiple intelligences in their effective use of reading strategies. To this end, a TOEFL reading comprehension test was administered to a cohort of 135 English as a foreign language students at several universities in the southwest and centre of Iran, and 80 students were identified as successful L2 readers based on the ETS rating scale and their TOEFL scores. Then, they answered an MI questionnaire originally developed by Armstrong and a reading strategies inventory adapted by Singhal. The data were quantitatively analysed using correlations and multiple regressions. The results revealed that linguistic, logical-mathematical and intrapersonal intelligences were the good L2 readers' most dominant intelligences, while bodily intelligence was the least common type. In addition, they mostly employed metacognitive and cognitive strategies but rarely drew upon affective and compensation strategies while reading. Further, there was a significant positive relationship between linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligences and the use of metacognitive and cognitive reading strategies. Similar relationships were also found between linguistic intelligence and the participants' use of memory strategy, on one hand, and between interpersonal intelligence and compensation and social strategy use, on the other. Importantly, linguistic and intrapersonal intelligences as well as metacognitive and cognitive strategy use were shown to be the best predictors of reading comprehension. Finally, the theoretical or pedagogical implications of the findings are discussed. },

The essential characteristics of project-based multimedia learning are determined, in particular, the importance of a teacher's role during the organization of project-based multimedia learning at primary school is emphasized. Critical analysis of theoretical and practical research has proven the need to study the influence of the information and communication technologies on primary school children with different types of intelligence. The empirical study has identified the correlation between types of intelligence and ICT tools for teaching young students. The authors of the study conclude that the use of multimedia educational projects increases interest and motivates students to engage in learning activities taking into account their psychological features, helps participants in the educational process to rationally plan their activities and better perceive and remember information. The article substantiates the technology of project-based multimedia learning of primary school children in accordance with the theory of multiple intelligences, which determines the sequence of a teacher's steps for effective organization of project-based multimedia learning based on H. Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. The steps or stages of the proposed technology include determining the dominant types of intelligences of each student in the class; organizing students into homogeneous or heterogeneous groups according to their types of intelligences, taking into consideration the goals and objectives of the multimedia project; dividing responsibilities in the group and supporting each student's work with the appropriate software or Internet resource; conducting general control over the work of the project groups and assisting in the presentation of the multimedia project results. },

  abstract={ A neuromyth is a commonly accepted but unscientific claim about brain function. Many researchers have claimed Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences (MI) theory is a neuromyth because they have seen no evidence supporting his proposal for independent brain-based intelligences for different types of cognitive abilities. Although Gardner has made claims that there are dedicated neural networks or modules for each of the intelligences, nonetheless Gardner has stated his theory could not be a neuromyth because he never claimed it was a neurological theory. This paper explains the lack of evidence to support MI theory. Most important, no researcher has directly looked for a brain basis for the intelligences. Moreover, factor studies have not shown the intelligences to be independent, and studies of MI teaching effects have not explored alternate causes for positive effects and have not been conducted by standard scientific methods. Gardner's MI theory was not a neuromyth initially because it was based on theories of the 1980s of brain modularity for cognition, and few researchers then were concerned by the lack of validating brain studies. However, in the past 40 years neuroscience research has shown that the brain is not organized in separate modules dedicated to specific forms of cognition. Despite the lack of empirical support for Gardner's theory, MI teaching strategies are widely used in classrooms all over the world. Crucially, belief in MI and use of MI in the classroom limit the effort to find evidence-based teaching methods. Studies of possible interventions to try to change student and teacher belief in neuromyths are currently being undertaken. Intervention results are variable: One research group found that teachers who knew more about the brain still believed education neuromyths. Teachers need to learn to detect and reject neuromyths. Widespread belief in a neuromyth does not make a theory legitimate. Theories must be based on sound empirical evidence. It is now time for MI theory to be rejected, once and for all, and for educators to turn to evidence-based teaching strategies. },

  abstract={ This study was conducted to explore the trends and future directions of multiple intelligences studies in adults. Multiple intelligences studies in adults are numerically less than in infants, primary and secondary students. The reason is that multiple intelligences has been tried with a focus on the age level, where various activities and experiments are possible, crossing subjects in the context of teaching and learning. In contrast, multiple intelligences research for adults is at a time when it is necessary to expand the breadth and depth of research. This is significant not only in expanding and diversifying the application of multiple intelligences theory, but also in taking advantage of the different strengths of individuals and members of the fourth industrial revolution. For this study, on February 27, 2020, Korean journals were searched for 'multiple intelligences', and in addition to a total of 1,617 cases, 22 'multiple intelligences adults', 54 'multiple intelligences college students', and 138 'multiple intelligences teachers' were drawn. Of these, the final 55 papers related to the subject of this study were confirmed and analyzed. After several reviews and corrections, quantitative analysis was performed. The results of the study were presented as item-by-item and inter-item results for the research year and subject, field, content, and methods. Based on the results of the study, discussions and conclusions, limitations of the study, and future suggestions were made. Through this study, we can examine the research trends applied in the context of multiple intelligences in detail and confirm that multiple intelligences can be a useful educational frame to lead the individual's self-realization, growth, and happy life through generations. },

The theory of multiple intelligences have been thought of as an alternative educational paradigm which can not only overcome uniform schooling problems, but also nourish the potentials of our students(or pupils) under the entrance exam system of Korea. Multiple intelligences theory, presented by Howard Gardner, is quite radical in itself. Nevertheless, it can play a useful role to effectively implement the national level curriculum, and in holistic education as well. Although moral intelligence doesn't exist in the list of multiple intelligences, there is close relationship between curriculum of moral education and multiple intelligences. Upon the basis of the affinity of multiple intelligences for multimedia, additionally, I will treat the team project activities as an example of teaching & learning model or performance assessment. },

This research focuses on the study of intelligence from the perspective of Howard Gardner's multidisciplinary perspective. Objective. This study aimed to determine and compare the level of development of multiple intelligences in engineering students at the Universidad Tecnologica de Panama [Technological University of Panama-UTP] by faculty and major in order to provide recommendations to improve teaching methods. Method. This descriptive-comparative field research with a quantitative approach consisted of 85 students in their final year of engineering studies. They were administered a questionnaire adapted from the IAMI-R psychological instrument. After data collection, descriptive and comparative statistical analyzes were performed using Minitab. Results. The results indicate that linguistic and logical -mathematical intelligences are the most prevalent in the students of the different faculties at the UTP. Conversely, bodily-kinesthetic and naturalistic intelligences are among the two least developed for 83% of the faculties, except for the Faculty of Science and Technology, where naturalistic intelligence is the third least developed. Conclusion. It is concluded that there are significant differences in the level of development of multiple intelligences between faculties and majors to which the UTP students belong. The study determines that bodily-kinesthetic and naturalistic intelligences are among the least developed. For this reason, it is recommended that the university implements activities to develop these intelligences, such as dramatization or studying body language. },

In this conversation with Weiss, Gardner advises trainers to regard technology as a tool-one used to educate but not to dictate educational goals. When confronting technology-assisted learning, ask yourself, What are the educational goals? and How can this technology help me achieve them? Gardner, well known for his theory of multiple intelligences, notes that technologies can invite learners to use several intelligences. He observes that new technologies make materials vivid, easy to access, and fun to play with, and that they address humans' multiple ways of knowing. Gardner also believes that technology shouldn't be intimidating and that, as we get accustomed to it, it will become less so. Weiss writes: Gardner believes that as people become more comfortable with electronic media, the media will become indistinguishable from earlier, more familiar forms such as books or graphics. },

The results of the study were as follows：First, there were significant differences between gifted young children and ordinary young children in linguistic intelligence, musical intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, and naturalist intelligence.Second, for gifted young children, the mothers' eight areas of multiple intelligence significantly predicted the same areas of children's multiple intelligences. Fathers' musical intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, and intrapersonal intelligence also predicted gifted young children's intelligence in the same areas. On the other hand, mothers' education predicted young children's interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence.Third, for ordinary young children, mothers' multiple intelligence significantly predicted the same areas of ordinary young children's multiple intelligences. Only fathers' bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, however, predicted the ordinary young children's bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. There was no relationship between ordinary young children's multiple intelligences and mothers' education. },

First of all, 8 multiple intelligences comprising the framework of career exploration showed significant correlation among them. Intrapersonal intelligence which unifies, applies, and transfers other intelligences presented particularly high positive correlation with them. The next, according to the MI profile which is intellectual characteristics of middle school students and career guidance, interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence are higher than others, which coincides with 'psychosocial development theory' of Erik Homburger Erikson. Concerning the sex difference, male students were significantly high in bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, and natural intelligence while female students in musical intelligence. Third, the treatment was effective on the improvement of students' self-awareness; strength awareness and weakness awareness were fortified. Lastly, it was also effective for the career decision of students. To sum up, the information on the multiple intelligences test of students turned out to be important for students' path guidance in life. In addition to this, career education on the basis of multiple intelligences theory was found to be effective for the improvement of students' self-awareness and career guidance. More systematical researches on the career education and the diagnosis of multiple intelligences need to be followed. },

  abstract={ ABSTRACT In recent years, Multiple Intelligences (MI – bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, intrapersonal, interpersonal, linguistic, logical-mathematical, musical, and naturalist) and Learning Preferences (LP – visual, aural, read/write, kinesthetic, and multimodal) have been intensely studied throughout the world. In this context, plenty of tools that evaluate such parameters have been created and later improved over the past decades. Nowadays, the necessity for optimal learning strategies and more individualized teaching continues to rise, reinforcing the importance of identifying individual strengths and cognitive preferences. Objectives to analyze the distribution of MI – and how they influence one another – and LP in medical students at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR), Brazil. The results could lead to improvements in the educational setting. Methods a descriptive cross-sectional study involving UFPR medical students of all 12 semesters, who were analyzed through questionnaires with regard to both their MI (“Multiple Intelligences Checklist for Students”) and LP (“Visual, Aural, Read/Write, Kinesthetic – VARK – Questionnaire”). Results a total of 1054 questionnaires were processed (527 students). Intrapersonal (71 ± 10.5), logical-mathematical (69.3 ± 14), and linguistic (68.4 ± 11.8) intelligences predominated, whereas naturalist achieved the lowest mean score (47.3 ± 19.5). Positive correlations were identified between all of the MI. Regarding the LP, the multimodal (42.3%) was the most frequent, followed by visual (21.3%), aural (18.6%), kinesthetic (11.2%), and read/write (6.6%). When both cognitive theories were correlated, the following associations prevailed: visual LP and intrapersonal intelligence; aural LP and interpersonal intelligence; read/write LP and logical-mathematical intelligence; kinesthetic LP and logical-mathematical intelligence; and multimodal preference and intrapersonal intelligence. Conclusions intrapersonal intelligence achieved the highest overall scores, followed by logical-mathematical and linguistic. Naturalist intelligence achieved the lowest scores in terms of semester, cycle, and overall analysis. All MI were positively correlated. Multimodality was the most commonly observed LP, whereas the read/write preference was the least frequent. Correlations initially expected between MI and LP were confirmed. As for future perspectives, it is expected that teachers and education managers adapt current teaching strategies in order to meet the students’ preferences. Together, MI and LP indicate that the focus should not rely on how smart a given person is, but in which ways. },

  abstract={ This article explores the tensions between Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences and current educational policies emphasizing standardized and predictable outcomes. The article situates Gardner's theory within the historical interests among psychometricians in identifying those core processes that constitute human intelligence. Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences provides a significant contrast to the models of mind that have traditionally been used to understand how people think and make intelligent choices. The pursuit of a single G factor is contrasted with an array of specific intelligences in Gardner's conception. The implications of Gardner's view for education pertain to the cultivation of the various ways in which humans reflect intelligently and the implicit recommendation that individual proclivities, interests, and intelligences be cultivated. Such an approach to schooling would yield differences among the outcomes for children whose intelligences differed. It is this orientation to the aims of education that conflicts dramatically with a standards-driven approach to school improvement. },

The present paper is a descriptive correlational research. The statistical universe comprises all managers and teachers of public high schools in Tehran. Among 19 districts of Tehran, districts 2, 11 and 16 were selected randomly and among these districts, 60 managers (32 female and 28 male) and 300 teachers (160 female and 140 male) were selected via stratified - relative random sampling as per Morgan table. Data pertaining to multiple intelligences and managers skills were respectively collected through Gardner multiple intelligence questionnaire and interview-administrated questionnaire. The coefficients of Cronbach's alpha for multiple intelligences questionnaire and skills questionnaire are 0.89 and 0.93, respectively. The results of research analyzed via Pearson correlation test and T-test reveal that there is a significant relation between all multiple intelligences dimensions, except for verbal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence, and the managers' technical skills. There is a significant relation between all multiple intelligences dimensions, except for bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, and the managers' human skills. There is a significant relation among all multiple intelligences dimensions, except for bodily-kinesthetic intelligence and spatial-visual intelligence, and the managers' conceptual skills. Also there is no significant relation among the managers' gender and their human and conceptual skills, and there is only a significant relation between technical skills and gender, that is, technical skills of female managers are higher than male managers. No significant relation was seen between managers multiple intelligences dimensions and gender. [Zeinab Sadeghi, Bijan Abdollahi.

  abstract={ Introduction: the assessment of intelligence is one of the most controversial aspects in the education and psychological fields. It is measured through psychometric testing which only takes into consideration some of the dimensions and cognitive processes, such as verbal understanding, level of knowledge, verbal training of concepts, skills of abstract and concrete reasoning, logical thinking, memory, language development, ability to classify and generalize numerical reasoning, mental calculation, speed in the mental processes, use of the practical knowledge, the use of judgement in social situations, common sense, moral and ethical judgement, attention and concentration and do not take others into consideration, such as location of space, tone, rhythm and musical intonation, capabilities to precisely perceive the visual world, realize transformations and modifications to the initial perceptions, even in the absence of proper physical stimuli, control of proper body movements and the capability to handle objects with skill, access to their own private life, ability to notice and establish differences between other individuals and, in particular, between mood swings, temperament, motivations and intentions. In addition, they underestimate the influence of the environment on the subject’s performance; this situation becomes more complex when assessing people with cognitive disabilities. Thus, it is necessary to assess the intellectual capabilities through qualitative, less diminishing processes, as Howard Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligences suggests. Method: related study with emphasis in establishing the degree of relation between the variables (contextual test PCI and WISC-R). Results: the study showed that there is no direct relation between the subtests of the intelligence test WISCR and PCI, which indicates that both of them consider different aspects of similar processes. With the contextual test it was possible to observe abilities and competences that would hardly be demonstrated through a formal test. However, it is necessary to admit that there was a low population performance. Conclusion: although the performance of the population that was subject to this study was relatively low in both tests, the evaluation through a contextual test contributes significant elements to the processes of incorporating the disabled population into schools, facilitating the development of other competitions and their adjustment to the school environment. },

  abstract={ This paper is to introduce the theory of multiple intelligences(MI) developed by Howard Gardner into the education of arts and to exemplify it in the practice of the subjects of studium generale in the university. As a productive alternative of the evaluation system IQ after Binet, the theory has influenced much in the fields of education. The theory itself is based on the idea of culture and its symbolic form. It has changed in the course of time the idea of the ability of students, thereafter programmatic and structural aspects of the education. It is its strong side that stresses the value and ability of whole members of the society according to their ability and role, but not the individuals according to the scores fixed by numbered intelligence.Two experiments done by the researchers in the education of arts reveal some positive aspects of the theory. In the subject of tried to introduce a new evaluation system letting the criteria be mediated by students, not by instructor. It has its positive results: the commentaries and notes given by each student reveal his strength in terms of multiple intelligences to point out the structure of intelligence profile. Some students covered the critic positively and showed not any hesitation in doing the revision. The second experiment of in the music subject, it focused on the program itself organized systematically in order for the students to take an active role in the subject. From the beginning on the instructor stepped back, instead, the students organized in form of group to participate voluntarily and actively in the process of the program. The production as a work is given from the start and the idea of perception in the theory is accompanied through the semester long. The reflective activity is clarified through setting criteria and evaluation by the students themselves. This project showed the positive aspect of the theory that each student developed his own ability and covered the weakness and transmitted the strength of the intelligence to others. },

It’s basically meant to create the educational conditions for every child to exert his or her abilities.Two research questions were posed:1. What should be the objectives, content and teaching-learning methods of a Korean language education program based on multiple intelligences?2.What effect does a Korean education program based on multiple intelligences have on children’s multiple intelligences, self-efficacy and achievement motivation?The subjects in this study were 58 students in two different third- grade classes in M elementary school in the city of Daejeon. A Korean language education program based on multiple intelligences was implemented during a 4month period of time, and an inclusive approach of multiple intelligences and cooperative learning were applied.The major findings of the study were as follows:First, in order to develop a Korean education program based on multiple intelligences, the kinds of themes that could cover multiple intelligences in an inclusive way were selected in consideration of the learning objectives of the major units of a third-grade language arts textbook(second semester) of the 7th national elementary language arts curriculum. And then an inclusive Korean education program was prepared, which consisted of four stages: problem awareness, problem- solving planning, problem solving, and reflection/application/development.Second, the Korean education program based on multiple intelligences had a positive effect on the children’s multiple intelligences, self-efficacy and achievement motivation and suggested some of new directions for school education that typically stressed linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences only. },

They searched about seriously individual characteristics and individual differences, the human capacity for the development of potential intelligence and character. However, Montessori emphasized the absorbent mind and normalization of infants, Gardner stressed Multiple Intelligences including character development and the cultural experience.In practical terms, the difference between the two theories looks great. Montessori suggested concrete educational methods : the Individualized Education internal action, freedom, mixed-age group, and prepared environment.

  abstract={ The main purpose of this study was to explore the possibility that the different kinds of measurement methods produce different factor structures of multiple intelligences. Scales of normative and ipsative forms were introduced as the different kinds of measurement methods. In the psychometric approach to multiple intelligences, normative scale has been mainly utilized, but ipsative one rarely. In order to compare the factor structures raised from the two different forms, two tasks needed to be performed prior to it. The first task was to develop and validate an ipsative scale, and the second was to check the existence of method effect. In terms of reliability, criterion validity, and construct validity, ipsative scale was acceptable. Multitrait-multimethod latent factor analysis revealed that the method effect and the trait effect coexisted in the measurement of multiple intelligences. The results of the third task, which is same as the main purpose of this study, showed that the factor structures were a little different according to the different methods. In normative measurement, g-factor-nested model was most acceptable. In ipsative measurement, it was difficult to decide which model is more acceptable between eight-factors-flat model and g-factor-nested model. The most valuable finding of this study is the usability of a new ipsative scale in the assessment of multiple intelligences. },

We initially thought that there is a correlation between some of the intelligence types and leadership behaviors. We also hypothesized that some of the intelligence types contribute to leadership behaviors of students. The aim of this study was to determine the participants' leadership behaviors and their multiple intelligences and the second aim of this study was to find the relationship between these two variables. 1199 students from 15 universities' schools of physical education and sports participated to our study and filled the questionnaires. Some gender differences were found. Moreover, Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that, most of the variables in multiple intelligences and leadership were significantly correlating with each other at very high level. Additionally, it was found that intrapersonal intelligence, logical/mathematical intelligence and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence contribute to initiation of structure and total leadership behaviors. },

The results of this study was as follow: there were significant differences between emotional intelligence and academic self-concept based on multiple intelligences level. In other words, the higher the level of multiple intelligences can see more emotional intelligence and high academic self-concept. Each intelligence is acting together to affect each other. Strengthening multiple intelligence increases the satisfaction and attitudes toward learning in school. In turn, it gives a positive effect on academic self-concept. Therefore there is a need to understand the relationship between individual characteristics and profiles of the child's multiple intelligences and emotional intelligence, academic self-concept. Then, by helping a child to more efficiently learn based on our understanding of the relationships among the variables, the individual can maximize their potential and learning competencies. },

The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s α, Pearson’s correlation, and hierarchical regression analysis using SPSS version 18.0. It was found that both multiple intelligences and temperament types have partial influences on play behaviors of young children; it was confirmed that among multiple intelligences of children, logical-mathematical intelligence influences onlooker behaviors in a positive way, body-kinesthetic intelligence has a positive effect on rough-and-tumble play, and musical intelligence positively affects social play during free-choice play. Also, children with a difficult temperament were more likely to participate in solitary play than children with a slow temperament. These results imply that teachers' guidance and involvement of children's play should differ by types of temperament and levels of multiple intelligence in children. },

This study was designed to evaluate the reliability of the Teele Inventory of Multiple Intelligences (TIMI) and the relationship between intellectual preferences and reading achievement. The TIMI was administered to 288 urban 4th-grade students. Results suggest that the TIMI subscales, which examine preferences for linguistic, logical-mathematical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, musical, spatial, and bodily-kinesthetic intelligences, were found to have poor to moderate reliability. Students with higher scores on logical-mathematical intelligence were more likely to demonstrate at or above grade-level reading comprehension scores compared with students who scored lower on logical-mathematical intelligence, but none of the other MI scales was predictive of student achievement. Implications for test development and assessment of MI are discussed. },

The study was guided by the eight indicators of multiple intelligences suggested by Howard Gardner. We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 20 educators from a university in the northern region of Malaysia. The thematic analysis guided by Braun and Clarke shows a number of reasons why educators included the indicators in designing their content for micro-credential. Educators generally demonstrated that they used all the multiple intelligences indicators in designing the micro-credentials. The findings are encouraging and suggest that all eight intelligences can be included in designing micro-credentials to enhance students' learning experiences with the help of technology. Finally, the authors suggest a pedagogical framework that can be considered by educators who intend to design the micro-credentials. },

  abstract={ Recent research on students’ multiple intelligences, self-efficacy, and language learning strategies has provided evidence for the development of crucial constructs and generalizations which have direct applications to language classrooms. The present study examined the interrelationships between the strategies language learners take, their level of self-efficacy, and the types of their intelligences (based on Gardner’s (1983) Theory of Multiple Intelligences). To do so, Nation’s (1990) 50-item multiple - choice vocabulary test was administered by a university department to form homogeneous groups across all the majors of the department. Then, three surveys were adapted to explore the links between (1) Self-efficacy in Reading (SER) (Prat-Sala & Redford, 2010), (2) a Multiple Intelligence Scale (Armstrong, 1993), and (3) Oxford’s (1990) Language Learning Strategies. The most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison was that self-efficacy had no significant correlation with multiple intelligences. However, as expected, there was a significant correlation between language learners’ perceptions of their self-efficacy and their language leaning strategies. Additionally, a multiple regression analysis indicated notable results on the use of self-efficacy and multiple intelligences to predict language learning strategies. },

First, it provides the potential of the MI theory for science teaching and learning. Then an MI science lesson that was developed based on a modified model in the literature and implemented in an 80(th) grade classroom is given as a concrete example in order to help preservice and inservice science teachers to create bridges from the theoretical framework of the MI theory into classroom practice. This study uncovers that there are four important factors affecting how MI science lessons are planned and carried out. They are: (1) identifying individual students' multiple intelligences or strengths via a reliable and valid tool, (2) paying attention to the literature findings related to students' difficulties in leaming the relevant science topic, (3) considering the nature of the knowledge structure that students are supposed to learn with respect to the MI, and (4) examining teacher's ability to manage the MI activity. },

  issn={ 1229-8360 },
  abstract={ This paper is an attempt to make a conversation between theological education and Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory in the context of the information and technology era. From its emergence in the 1980s, MI theory has been usually applied to education for children or youth. Although it has not been actively applied to adult education, MI theory has strong implications for adult education as well as for theological education. Keeping this in mind, this paper focuses on theological education in terms of such key concepts as: 1) disciplinary understanding, 2) multi-modal teaching and learning methods, 3) Good Work, and 4) a transversal model of interdisciplinary conversation in MI theory. First, the concept of disciplinary understanding of MI theory awakens theological education to the importance of the contextual, performative, and intuitive nature of understanding. Second, the concept of multi-modal teaching and learning methods helps theological education employ various creative and alternative teaching and learning methods. Third, the concept of Good Work imbues theological education with the significance of the unity between the professional and ethical aspect in educating pastoral leadership. Fourth, a transversal model of interdisciplinary conversation provides theological education a fresh way of interdisciplinary dialogue that helps keep both the integrity and intelligence of theology and theological education together. Despite the significance of MI theory for theological education, this paper, however, does not accept the reductionist attitude that MI can provide all the answers to theological education. In this sense, the interdisciplinary dialogue between theology and other disciplines in this paper is made in a transversal manner. },

Thus, integrating multiple intelligences into textbook activities can allow students to perceive the contents in a contextualized manner, enabling critical action. Our goal was to investigate the degree of representation of multiple intelligences in ecological teaching content activities in books provided by the National Textbook Program of 2018, under the perspective of Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences. We used a checklist based on this theory to examine the various intelligences in biology book activities. Ten collections were analyzed using a descriptive analytical method. The analysis revealed that the majority of the books focused on verbal/linguistic, visual/spatial, naturalistic, and logical/mathematical intelligences, while interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences were observed infrequently, and bodily/kinesthetic and musical intelligences were not detected. The results indicate an imbalanced distribution of intelligences in the examined books, suggesting that the absent intelligences could be addressed by teachers to enrich the teaching material. },

The present study was designed based on previous studies, and theses studies proposed children’s academic achievements were not only closely related to academic motivations and but also significantly connected with multiple intelligences. The preliminary survey was conducted with 17 students, and subjects of this study were 312 elementary school students in Gangbuk-gu, Seoul. ARCS model for academic motivation developed by Keller was used to revise the academic motivation test composed of eighty-one questions. The multiple intelligences scale developed by Moon (2001) based on MIDAS (Shearer, 1996) was used to measure. Also, students’academic achievement data were analyzed. The data were analyzed by using Structural Equation Model with AMOS was used.The results of this study were as follows; First, academic motivation was more important than intelligence for language, math and science, whereas intelligence was more important than academic motivation for music, arts, and physical education. In short, this study would have great significance that makes a profound academic achievement study of the relationship between academic motivation and multiple intelligences with elementary students. },

  abstract={ Digital libraries are increasingly serving a worldwide audience. Persons of different cultural backgrounds can hold diverse perceptions of what constitutes an effective, efficient and satisfying information-seeking experience, and digital library design therefore grows more complex when its user population traverses cultural boundaries. This paper reviews the state of research on cross-cultural digital library usability and identifies reasons for lack of progress in the field. An improved framework is proposed to support the discussion and evaluation of subjective cultural factors in a deeper, more systematic fashion. The cognitive theory of Howard Gardner, multiple intelligences theory, is explored as one potential framework for exploring cross-cultural digital library usability. Each component of Gardner's theory is introduced, placed in a cultural context, and then briefly reviewed in terms of its potential application to digital libraries. Alternative frameworks, particularly the cultural dimensions theory of Geert Hofstede, are also introduced. Multiple intelligences theory is found to be helpful for understanding the nature of cultural variables, but not readily translatable into operational design principles for digital libraries. Combining multiple intelligences cognitive theory with cultural theory and global HCI design principles may prove a useful direction for future research. },

Secondly, we discuss in detail some of the seven criticisms which Rost has offered and demonstrate that they rest either on an incomplete assimilation or misconceptions of MI theory. Thirdly, Rost's very narrow criteria for science (scientificness) give reason to argue in favour of methodological and theoretical pluralism in educational psychology. },

After employing, companies tend to distribute their works, focusing on their organization’s needs and the order of priority in works, not human resources that individuals have, such as preference intelligences. Thus, it is important to examine strengths of Multiple Intelligences(MI) framework to confirm, develop, and apply their members’ abilities.Multiple Intelligences(MI) theory has focused on infant, elementary, and secondary school education, so there are little research nor discussion on MI based on adult’s work-related situation.

It also sought to investigate teachers' perceptions about the theory of multiple intelligences. To this end, 30 male and female EFL instructors teaching the same textbook with the same method of teaching participated in the present study. To gather the data, three successive sessions of each class were observed and the class activities were recorded through an observation schedule. Semistructured interviews were also carried out to explore the teachers' perceptions of multiple intelligences. And finally, teachers' dominant type of intelligence was determined by Multiple Intelligences Checklist. The results of one-way ANOVA and post hoc test revealed that only teachers of logical-mathematical type were influenced by their dominant intelligence type and other intelligence types did not exert a significant influence on the types of activities being implemented in the classes. The results of this study can be a fillip at least for teachers with logical-mathematical intelligence to be careful about their dominant intelligence type, not allowing it to affect their teaching and to compel them to use activities in line with their dominant intelligence. },

The experimental group was instructed through Multiple Intelligence strategies while the control group employed traditional methods. The assessment tools were the Diversity of Living Things Concepts Test (DLTCT) and the Teele Inventory of Multiple Intelligences (TIMI). Before treatment, no statistically significant difference between the groups was found in terms of understanding of diversity of living things concepts. After treatment, independent t-test analysis indicated that MII produced significantly greater achievement in the understanding of diversity of living things concepts (p < 0.05) and on students' retention of knowledge (p < 0.05). The results of TIMI revealed that fourth grade students' most dominant intelligence was logical-mathematical intelligence both before and after treatment. However, after treatment, some variations were observed. },

  abstract={ A Study on the Effects of Multiple Intelligences and Cognitive Strategies on Academic Achievement of Middle and High School Students This research aimed to probe the relationships and effects of multiple intelligences and cognitive strategies on academic achievements of the middle and high school students in Seoul. Participants included the seventh-to-eleventh-grade students with average academic achievements (n=603). The analysis of variance and regression analysis were performed to examine the relationship.The key findings suggested that there is a positive correlation between the academic achievement and sub-factors of multiple intelligences except for natural, bodily-kinetic, and relationship intelligence.Secondly, it showed that academic achievements are associated with linguistic, logical, spatial and natural intelligence. In the analysis of cognitive strategies, abilities to demonstrate and elaborate are related as well.The study found that level of language, logical-mathematical and musical intelligences among multiple intelligences and that of all the cognitive strategies created meaningful difference in terms of academic achievement. },

  abstract={ This study investigated the relationship among sex, attitude toward intelligence, and self-estimation of multiple intelligences for self and parents among Portuguese adolescents in secondary schools. Two hundred and forty-two adolescents estimated their own and their parents' IQ scores on each of Gardner's 10 multiple intelligences: verbal (linguistic), logical (mathematical), spatial, musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, existential, spiritual, and naturalistic. They also answered six simple questions concerning intelligence and intelligence tests. There were various sex differences in self-estimated IQ: males rated themselves higher on overall, mathematical, spatial, intrapersonal, spiritual, and naturalistic IQ compared with females. Multiple regressions indicated that verbal, logical, and intrapersonal intelligence were significant predictors for self and parents overall IQ estimations. Factor analysis of the 10, the 8, and the 7 self-estimates scores did not confirm Gardner's classification of multiple intelligences. Males were more likely to believe in sex differences in intelligence than females. Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the self-estimates of intelligence, as well as limitations of that approach. },

A total of 29 articles were collected for analyses based on their tools’ general features, as well as reliability and validity related information. Following this, 15 articles that dealt with assessment tools for young children were separately analyzed in greater detail. Significant findings are as follows. First, multiple intelligences assessment tools were predominantly developed in the 2000’s. Second, the majority of these tools were aimed at young children. Third, the tools for young children sought to measure children’s achievement results. Fourth, all of the assessment tools, including those that were developed based on the project spectrum method were standardized through reliability and validity procedures. Fifth, the assessment tools for children were developed comprehensively for all seven or eight intelligence areas. Sixth, the main evaluators conducting the assessment were researchers themselves. Seventh, the most frequently used assessment method was observation. Implications and suggestions for future research were discussed. },

  abstract={ This study, operating in a project-based education curriculum, focuses on the portfolio assessment process and applies the multiple intelligences theory to assess early childhood development. It aims to build a conceptual framework, based on the effects of an alternative assessment. This qualitative single case study selected 26 preschoolers, aged 4 to 5, from Nuri class at Sarang Day Care Center and over a 19-month period observed them, while applying the multiple intelligences theory, as they participated in class. The portfolio assessment data was analyzed; systematic data collection and analysis were made possible by document analysis and through in-depth interviews with two teachers and six parents. The study found that the portfolio assessment system emphasized a balance of power shifts and choices shared responsibly by the teachers, parents, and children. This system could be used to bring about the growth of teachers, parents and children corresponding to the objectives of early childhood assessment. Such an alternative assessment framework, one that is amenable to the early education field, can be classified as a tool to recognize interests, determine developmental level, reflect introspection, or share meaning with others. The study found that the Nuri class’s portfolio assessment provided a usable alternative assessment framework; participants were able to stimulate growth by building a harmonious learning community, by understanding differences through children’s self-examinations, and by focusing on each child’s strengths. },

To explore this, the study investigated two research questions: (a) What are the effects of English instruction using multiple intelligences and stories on underachievers’ reading abilities? and (b) How English instruction using multiple intelligences and stories influences on their learning attitudes? The participants of the study were seven fifth-grade underachievers in one elementary school in Seoul. They were first tested what their strong intelligences are and engaged in customized activities based on their multiple intelligences test results during the experiment English classes. The data collected include the read-aloud test, the reading comprehension test, the affective test, students’ learning log and the interview of students and teachers, and these were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results of the study showed that English instruction using multiple intelligences and stories had statistical significance in increasing underachievers’ reading abilities and changing their learning attitudes positively. This study is valuable in that it strongly calls for the need to consider multiple intelligences and provide customized activities for underachievers to facilitate their English learning and restore their learning attitudes. },

For the study, domestic and international prior research related to measuring multiple intelligences was first reviewed. To operationally define multiple intelligences and develop test items, a panel of 13 experts underwent two rounds of Delphi surveys, resulting in 155 preliminary test items. A preliminary test was administered online to 375 participants, and after item analysis, 122 items were selected for the main test. The main test was administered to 1,062 participants, and after verifying item quality and considering test practicality through research team meetings, 97 final items were confirmed. The final developed test confirmed construct validity through confirmatory factor analysis, and the reliability of the eight multiple intelligence domains ranged from .811 to .878, which is satisfactory. To verify concurrent validity, 87 of the main test participants took the Career Development Competency Test for Elementary Students, confirming significant correlations between competencies measuring similar domains and intelligences. },

Method: I analyzed 39 journals published from 2001 to 2015. Results: The results indicated that research on the multiple intelligence of students with disabilities has little been studied for the last two or three years. In addition, in terms of research methods, researchers focused on quantitative research, especially experimental and survey research. In addition, many studies were conducted to investigate the multiple intelligence traits (types) of students with disabilities, with assessment scales for multiple intelligence characteristics as the main focus. The multiple intelligences of students with communication disabilities, health disabilities, and multiple disabilities have not been studied are not being studied, so research in these areas is needed. Conclusion: In order to activate multiple intelligence research related to students with disabilities, researchers should use various research methods and consider a variety of disability classifications. In addition, the multiple intelligences of students with disabilities should be examined through methods other than item evaluations of multiple intelligences, so educational methods for addressing the multiple intelligences of students with disabilities can be better developed. },

All children took the 'Student Multiple Intelligences Profile' (SMIP) questionnaire as part of a bigger project that gathered data around concepts and beliefs of talent. This paper sets out two aims, first to investigate the structural representation of the self perceived multiple intelligences for this set of children and second to discuss how the best fit model might reflect children's culture and their school experiences. After carrying out exploratory factor analysis, a four factor first order model was shown to have a good fit. A higher order factor solution was investigated owing to the correlation of two latent constructs. In order to provide some insight into the multiple intelligences construct the relationship between the SMIP items, student test outcomes and attitudes to learning were examined. The item groupings were explored through African cultural beliefs around intelligences indigenous to African communities. },

  abstract={ The crisis of current Korean church lies in pastoral leadership both directly and indirectly.We may, thus, say that there is no hope for the Korean church’s future without transforming present theological education. This study first identifies the problems of current theological education that resulted from: separation or discontinuity between formal theological education at theological seminaries (or theological schools) and informal theological education, lack of perspective of life long education, and insufficient recognition of the harsh challenges of the future society to the church. All these problems operate as significant obstacles to developing pastoral leadership for local church pastors.Based on the problems mentioned above, this study aims to seek an alternative form of future pastoral leadership, in terms of Howard Gardner’s “Five Minds for the Future” (the disciplined mind, synthesizing mind, creating mind, respectful mind,and ethical mind). In developing the alternative form of the future pastoral leadership,this study, first, introduces the outline of Gardner’s Five Minds for the Future. Then,after reconceptualizing the five minds in terms of biblical and theological perspectives,this study proposes the educational principles for developing future pastoral leadership. Due to the constraints regarding length, this study mostly strives to lay only the most fundamental elements of the proposed model. },

  abstract={ Background: Multiple Intelligences theory (MITE was developed as an account of human cognition. Gardner (1993) asserts that MIT is very important and beneficial for educational implications. Different studies supports that there are potentials to enhance the educational practices through MIT (Harvard Project Zero, 2004) and positive effects occur on students, teachers, and parents. The initial findings of the studies support the idea that implementations of NUT for a year have constructive effects on all individual in teaching and learning process (Saban, 2002). However, the study of the effects of MIT on 1(st) graders' Literacy Education (LE) is somewhat rare or left unstudied while the research literature abounds with the effects of the principles of MIT on different subjects in different grades.Purpose of the Study: The purpose of the present study was to find out whether the implementation of MIT has any effect on Literacy Education (LE) and to explore first graders' tendency towards the course and the teachers.Methods: The qualitative data were gathered from one 1(st) grade classroom with 26 students, five 1(st) grade teachers from Baskent University College Ay e Abla Schools, and four 1(st) grade teachers from Gazi University Foundation Private Primary School. Data collected through interviews, observations, students' drawings and writings about the LE, students' portfolios, photographs, written document and Teele Inventory for Multiple Intelligences (TIMI) and analyzed by employing descriptive and content analysis techniques.Findings: Results underlined the fact that the effects of the MIT on the 1(st) graders' LE and tendency towards the course and their teachers were positive. Also, some variations were observed in terms of the students' multiple intelligences throughout the LE.Conclusions: MIT makes its greatest contribution to education by means of suggesting the idea that there are various ways to learn (Armstrong, 1994), The major impact of this study is about positive contribution of MIT on 1(st) graders' LE in terms of students' and teachers' tendencies towards the course and each others. Besides, it makes a difference in relation to developing students' multiple intelligences. Therefore, teachers should encourage students to participate in not only learning activities aimed at their dominant domain of intelligence but also learning activities aimed at their weak domain of intelligence in order to improve their intelligences in a holistic manner. },

The data gathered were analysed by using regression test. Findings from the study revealed that four domains of multiple intelligences significantly influenced student's achievements in Business Studies namely verbal linguistic intelligence, mathematical logic intelligence, interpersonal intelligence and spatial intelligence. The findings also showed that the other four domains of multiple intelligences were not significant in influencing the achievements of students in Business Studies, namely kinaesthetic intelligence, musical intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence and naturalistic intelligence. Overall, the findings conveyed that multiple intelligences have a positive impact among students in terms of behaviour, motivation and provided students the opportunity to identify their own strength, develop their own potentials, think creatively and critically and enable students to be valuable and excel in their academic achievements. In conclusion, multiple intelligences assist teachers to apply multiple intelligences in various ways to develop students potentials and to enhance academic achievements in Business Studies. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to design Practical Arts teaching-learning activities applying the multiple intelligences theory which has a lot of educational implications for developing learners' potential and improving learning efficiency and determine how such learning activities affect elementary school student's improvement in self-esteem. Two classes in the sixth grade were selected from P elementary school in Jeonju and then divided into experimental and control groups to conduct instruction. The experimental group was provided with instruction by reconstruction of the unit of “My Life which saves an environment” into the type of teaching-learning activities appropriate for the multiple intelligences theory, while the control group was provided with the traditional type of instruction. Each of the groups went through the pretest for self-esteem and post-test for self-esteem. The results of the study are as follows: First, Practical Arts Instruction applying the multiple intelligences theory was effective in improving the general self-esteem of students. Second, Practical Arts Instruction applying the multiple intelligences theory had positive effects on such a sub-factor of self-esteem as school self-esteem, but failed to be effective in holistic, social, and family self-esteem. },

In this methodological framework, the teacher designed and applied a strategy about water with a group of 25 first grade students, including some children with functional diversity (Attention Deficit Disorder -ADD-, learning disabilities without diagnosis, and blindness). This was so designed to respond to the diversity of children in terms of ways of learning, and facilitate its diverse expressions, as well as to seek environmental literacy. The teacher's achievements in the classroom are thus exposed with regards to teaching about water resources, drawing on the theory of multiple intelligences, together with the implications that collaborative research has for initial teacher preparation. },

A survey was conducted on the selected parents who had preschool children, and a multiple regression analysis was carried out to look for connections among the variables. The findings of the study were as follows: First, whether there would be any gender gaps between the preschoolers in multiple intelligences was analyzed, and there appeared significant gender gaps in linguistic intelligence, musical intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence and spatial intelligence. The preschool girls were ahead of the preschool boys in linguistic intelligence, musical intelligence and spatial intelligence, and the latter surpassed the former in logical-mathematical intelligence. Second, whether there would be any differences among the preschoolers in multiple intelligences according to age was analyzed, and those who were at the Western age of five were ahead of the four-year-olds in logical-mathematical intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence and naturalist intelligence. Third, a multiple regression analysis was made to grasp the relative influence of the parental beliefs,parental attitude and parental behavior of the parents on each of the multiple intelligences of the preschoolers, and the parental attitude of the parents was identified as the most influential variable for the multiple intelligences of the preschoolers, followed by parental behavior. Parental beliefs just had a very small impact on their multiple intelligences. The findings of the study imply that parents should be helped to improve their parental attitude and parental behavior to boost the multiple intelligences of their preschool children. },

  abstract={ Introduction Theory of multiple intelligences (MI) is considered an innovation in learning the English language because it helps students develop all eight intelligences that, on the other hand, represent ways people understand the world around them, solve problems and learn. They are: verbal/linguistic, logical/mathematical, visual/spatial, bodily/kinaesthetic, musical/rhythmic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalist. Also, by focusing on the problem-solving activities, teachers, by implementing theory of multiple intelligences, encourage students not only to build their existing language knowledge but also learn new content and skills.Objective The objective of this study has been to determine the importance of implementation of the theory of multiple intelligences in the English language course syllabus at the University of Nis Medical School.Methods Ways in which the theory of multiple intelligences has been implemented in the English language course syllabus particularly in one lecture for junior year students of pharmacy in the University of Nis Medical School.Results The English language final exam results from February 2009 when compared with the final exam results from June 2007 prior to the implementation of MI theory showed the following: out of 80 junior year students of pharmacy, 40 obtained grade 10 (outstanding), 16 obtained grade 9 (excellent), 11 obtained grade 8 (very good), 4 obtained grade 7 (good) and 9 obtained grade 6 (pass). No student failed.Conclusion The implementation of the theory of multiple intelligences in the English language course syllabus at the University of Nis Medical School has had a positive impact on learning the English language and has increased students' interest in language learning. Genarally speaking, this theory offers better understanding of students' intelligence and greater appreciation of their strengths. It provides numerous opportunities for students to use and develop all eight intelligences not just the few they excel in prior to enrolling in a university or college. },

  abstract={ The debate about whether, and in what sense, there is 'spiritual intelligence' remains unresolved. We suggest it will be helpful to make a distinction between strong and weak versions of the claim. The strong version proposes that there is a separate and distinct spiritual intelligence that meets the criteria set out by Howard Gardner in his 'multiple intelligences' framework. This involves evidence from neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, individual differences, experimental tasks, and psychometrics. We review the relevant evidence and conclude that there is no support for the strong proposal. The weak version of the claim assumes that the intelligence that is apparent in spiritual contexts is the same as is found elsewhere, but it is nevertheless deployed in a distinctive way. We suggest that the evidence supports the claim, and we review six key marks of spiritual intelligence: ineffability, embodiment, open-minded attention, pattern-seeking meaning-making, participation, and relationality. Our approach makes use of a cognitive architecture, Interacting Cognitive Subsystems (ICS), which has been proved useful in modelling spiritual practices. It will be helpful in the future to bring this approach into dialogue with other scientific approaches to spiritual intelligence from psychometrics and from experimental research. },

Such a view finds its theoretical ground in Gardner's multiple intelligences theory. Thus ICT literacy education in elementary school also needs to consider individual student's abilities and talents based on their multiple intelligences and apply appropriate education programs and teaching methods. In order to provide basic materials for this, the present study examined the correlation between children's academic achievement in ICT literacy education and their multiple intelligences and inquired into which intelligences are factors determining achievement in ICT literacy education. According to the results, logical-mathematical intelligence is in a significant correlation with academic achievement in ICT literacy education, and logical-mathematical intelligence and linguistic intelligence are the most influential factors on academic achievement in ICT literacy education. },

  abstract={ The purpose of present study was to evaluate English language teaching program of Iranian universities to see to what extent MI theory has been implemented in educational system. As Marsh (1997) holds curriculum starts as a plan; it only becomes a reality when teachers implement it with real students in a real classroom (cited in Anthony, 2008: 77). Since teachers and textbooks are manifestations of education in curriculum, the study intended to investigate how the content of textbooks represents multiple intelligences. In particular, it sought to indicate if the textbooks covered all types of multiple intelligences in line with university disciplines of students. Also, in order to find if MI theory is implemented in the program, a series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with university instructors of English. The aim of interviews was to find if instructors apply principles of MI in their classes. The results of this quantitative-qualitative study revealed that ELT textbooks covered a limited range of multiple intelligences i.e. mostly verbal/linguistics intelligence. In addition, the study indicated that MI principles are not applied in the English language classroom. Based on the views of instructors, some suggestions would be made regarding implementing MI in the English language curriculum. The results may be used as a guide for developing teacher education programs in Iran and other countries which are going to implement MI principles in their ELT curriculums. It is hoped that the findings will have an impact on policy makers as well as instructors' concerns about curriculum reform in universities. },

The highest overall ratings were in environmental, spiritual, and logical-mathematical intelligences, and the lowest in linguistic intelligence. Several gender- and grade-level-related differences appeared. Males with similar grades as females in physics, mathematics, and English perceived their intelligence as higher in logical-mathematical and spatial areas. Females thought more positively of their linguistic and environmental intelligence. The findings give cause for concern about genuine gender equity in education in a country such as Finland with high overall equality. },

  abstract={ The paper aims to make a systematic analysis of the literature that addresses the relationship between dance and multiple intelligences in order to identify the main theoretical aspects that underpin the design and implementation of educational interventions for institutionalised children to learn dance. This category of children is a permanent concern for specialists in the field of education sciences who are interested in finding the most effective methods and means of training that can support the educational and institutional efforts for the social integration of these children. Following the review of the literature provided by the main databases, a correspondence was made between the types of intelligence described by Gardner (1983) and the effects of dance on these intelligence modalities. The bibliographic analysis had as organisational criteria: multiple intelligences, dance, children at risk and the effects of dance on their growth and development. The correlative analysis has revealed a number of dance characteristics susceptible to have a positive influence on different types of intelligence and can serve as benchmarks in the interdisciplinary design of dance activities in general and dancesport in particular. As a result, the theoretical model presented in this paper represents a methodological benchmark for the implementation of enhanced programmes for the personal development of institutionalised children and the creation of additional conditions for their school and social integration. },

The results are as follows.First, the difference in Multiple intelligence according to gender was statistically significant in musical intelligence, spatial intelligence, linguistic intelligence, and interpersonal intelligence, and all female students had higher average values than male students.Second, the difference in attitude toward invention according to gender was statistically significant in the attitude of interest, practical attitude, and emotional attitude, and the average value of all male students was higher than that of female students.Third, as a result of analyzing the correlation between the multi-intelligence of elementary school students and their attitude toward invention, all were found to be significant.Fourth, as a result of correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis, it was found that logical mathematics intelligence had the highest influence. This means that invention classes can be conducted in a variety of subjects and fields, and can be used as basic data for activating convergence education between science subjects and invention education, which have similarities in multi-intelligence. },

  abstract={ A key goal of educational neuroscience is to conduct constrained experimental research that is theory-driven and yet also clearly related to educators' complex set of questions and concerns. However, the fields of education, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience use different levels of description to characterize human ability. An important advance in research in educational neuroscience would be the identification of a cognitive and neurocognitive framework at a level of description relatively intuitive to educators. I argue that the theory of multiple intelligences (MI; Gardner, 1983), a conception of the mind that motivated a past generation of teachers, may provide such an opportunity. I criticize MI for doing little to clarify for teachers a core misunderstanding, specifically that MI was only an anatomical map of the mind but not a functional theory that detailed how the mind actually processes information. In an attempt to build a functional MI theory, I integrate into MI basic principles of cognitive and neural functioning, namely interregional neural facilitation and inhibition. In so doing I hope to forge a path toward constrained experimental research that bears upon teachers' concerns about teaching and learning. },

  abstract={ This study examined the personality correlates of incremental/entity attitudes towards the growth/increase of 14 multiple intelligences. A total of 277 participants completed a questionnaire about the degree to which each type of intelligence is impossible/easy to change. This was followed by a 15-item Big Five personality traits questionnaire (Costa & McCrae, 1992), a measure of core self-evaluation (Judge et al., 2003) and a growth mindset questionnaire (Dweck, 2012). Whilst verbal, naturalistic and intra-personal intelligences were seen to be relatively easy to change, creative and musical intelligences were seen as much less so. The 14 intelligences factored into three interpretable factors labelled as abstract, skilful and classical intelligences. Core self-evaluation and growth mindset were both highly significant correlates of each factor. Whilst neuroticism and openness were significant correlates for abstract and classical intelligences respectively, no other significant results were obtained from the Big Five personality traits. These findings highlight the importance of core self-evaluation and mindset beliefs in educational and occupational settings. Limitations were noted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. },

Subjects were chosen from three kindergartens using the theme-oriented program, the Montessori program, and the ecological program. Sixty children were observed for this study. For the assessment of children's multiple intelligences, the pre-test and post-test were administered by parents and teachers. The collected data were analyzed by using ANOVA and ANCOVA. Scheffe and LSD were administered for multiple comparisons among the groups. The results obtained from this study can be summarized as follows:First, theme-oriented program, Montessori program, and ecological program had significant differences in the following four characteristics: the degree of structuralization, the frequency of interaction among children and teachers and teaching materials, the type of mediation used for interactions between children and teachers, the types of teaching materials when children use them.Second, the results showed that there were statistically significant differences among the three programs in the areas of bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, logical- mathematical intelligence, linguistic intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, and naturalistic intelligence. These results could be interpreted to indicate that the outcomes come from the different traits of the three programs. },

The MI theory proposes that every individual possesses unique strengths and weaknesses for learning that are characterized within eight intelligences: linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalistic. Wellness educators can center these intelligences and structure materials in a way that offers opportunities to engage more of the intelligences through student-centered practices. Doing so employs individual student strengths and fosters development in areas of weaknesses. Utilizing this theory in the planning of health and physical education content has an opportunity to increase understanding and enjoyment of lessons by establishing inclusive spaces for all students to engage in learning. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to better understand the secondary components of multiple intelligences that influence the creativity of high school students. To achieve this purpose, a study was performed with 300 high school students. The study’s results were analyzed using the linear regression. The results of the study are as follows. First, intrapersonal intelligence, linguistic intelligence, and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence are related to an independent spirit. Second, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence and linguistic intelligence are correlated to a spirit of adventure. Third, naturalist intelligence, logical- mathematical intelligence, and intrapersonal intelligence are related to attachment. Fourth, intrapersonal intelligence, linguistic intelligence, and bodily -kinesthetic intelligence are related to openness. According to the findings of this study, the intrapersonal intelligence affects the student’s independent spirit and their degree of attachment. Linguistic intelligence affects student’s spirit of independence, willingness for adventure, and openness. The bodily- kinesthetic intelligence also influences a student’s spirit of independence, willingness for adventure, and openness. The naturalist intelligence affects the student’s degree of attachment. In consideration of these findings, it is imperative that a program be developed to improve the intrapersonal, linguistic, bodily-kinesthetic, and naturalist intelligences. },

In language learning in particular, understanding students' learning strategies as well as their multiple intelligence profiles is significant because it allows the teachers to develop and design lessons and materials that are customised to their diverse learning needs. Hence, this study investigates the Multiple Intelligences (MI) and Language Learning Strategy (LLS) profiles of students from various science and technology faculties of Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Terengganu, with a focus on gender differences. The study's objectives were to determine the dominant students' MI profiles, their preferred LLS, and gender variations in these variables. Two instruments were adopted in this study, namely McKenzie's Multiple Intelligences Inventory and the Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL). The findings indicated that the students mostly acquire introspective intelligence, and the majority of male respondents use metacognitive learning strategies. However, the findings revealed a significant positive relationship between MI and LLS. Based on these findings, the study emphasises the importance of incorporating MI and LLS in language teaching and learning and provides recommendations for language teachers to create lesson plans and teaching materials that suit the students' needs. },

  abstract={ Design convergence talent (DCT) refers to a person who is talented in creative convergence design and possesses a degree in design or a related field. By analyzing typical and distinctive characteristics of DCTs, this study explored the depth of intelligence-based creativity. To identify DCTs, subjects were classified into four groups according to convergence (single or multiple domains) and college major (design or non-design). Creativity was assessed using the something About Myself (SAM) test, and multiple intelligences were rated using the Latent Ability Detection (LAD) test, on the basis of the Multiple Intelligence Theory of Gardner (1983, 1993). The DCT group had the highest creativity scores, followed by the non-design convergence talent(NDCT), design single-major (DSM), and non-design single-major (NDSM) groups. Regarding multiple intelligences, the DCT group was high in spatial and linguistic intelligences but low in interpersonal intelligence. Overall, spatial and linguistic intelligences were positively related to (but did not influence) creativity, while bodily kinesthetic and interpersonal intelligences were negatively related to (but did not influence) creativity. DCTs who had completed at least two design studies were more creative than NDCTs, which was presumably the result of the formation of an individual, creative mindset via the internalization of professionally trained design thinking. The results of this study offer a quantifiable basis for a DCT model as a means of creative-talent activation. At the industry level, the model may be useful for scouting and developing DCTs in order to establish a method of sustainable creation and innovative values. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Sternberg's theory of successful intelligence. In particular, musical intelligence involves creative, analytical, practical, and wisdom-based aspects. These components apply to both musical composition and performance and can apply as well to musical understanding and scholarship. In performance, for example, performers devise creative interpretations of composers' music, analyze their interpretations to ensure they are historically and musically defensible, perform the music in a way that is practical in reaching their audience, and do good in providing their listeners with enjoyment and sometimes new ways of thinking about the world. },

  abstract={ Curriculum and pedagogy in undergraduate fine art can promote an approach to learning creativity that is more about being an artist than knowing about art. Lecturers can provide a road map for developing particular dispositions, in relation to student ideas and perceptions, to foster personalised creativity. This requires that lecturers have an ability to harness the range of learning approaches and interests that students bring to their studio learning environments. One way of doing this is to construct learning activities in ways that engage students' multiple intelligences so they may acquire deeper understandings of their own creative processes. Fostering this kind of creative think tank is artistry of an educational kind. In this article we explore such a creative think tank by examining a particular lecturer's pedagogical approach. We discuss how and why this lecturer designs activities in a way that draws on multiple intelligences to stimulate learning and foster creativity. Using narratives, we analyse this particular curriculum through the lens of multiple intelligence theory and explore how the pedagogical approach develops the whole person. We found that by attending to relationships and focusing on a plurality of intellect this particular curriculum and pedagogy promotes transformative learning in students studying fine art. },

Second, given the results, musical, bodily-kinesthetic, logical-mathematical, spatial, and linguistic intelligence among the multiple intelligences were shown to have a statistically meaningful difference according to the children's gender, while auditory and tactile mode have such a difference among the learning perceptual modes. Third, there were differences in the multiple intelligences and in the learning perceptual modes regarding the children's subject preferences. These results showed that it could be effective to make lesson plans or let children study according to the characteristics of the individuals and the subjects, as certain multiple intelligence and learning perceptual mode were more used depending on the gender and the subject. },

  abstract={ This study proposes a lesson plan to teach Korean onomatopoeic and mimetic words to L2 learners using the Multiple Intelligences learning theory. It is reported that Korean learners find it difficult to learn Korean onomatopoeic and mimetic words because of distinctive features that rarely exist in the learners’ own languages. However, teaching onomatopoeic and mimetic words of tactile and gustatory sensations may lessen the learning difficulty and help them understand such words. In addition, applying Multiple Intelligences theory to teaching these kinds of words will allow L2 learners to utilize and further develop their intelligences, including linguistic and bodily/kinesthetic intelligence, thus facilitating their learning. The proposed lesson plan presents activities such as connecting target vocabulary with meaning of a food item by touching and tasting it, describing each item using target vocabulary, and listening to songs or watching TV commercials that include target vocabulary. },

  abstract={ Assessing giftedness is one of the inevitable processes in the identification of gifted schoolchildren which involves all the actors included in the direct contact with schoolchildren. Since the assessments are regarded as a subjective opinion of the assessor, our aim is to determine the level of certainty that we can take into account when assessing giftedness identification. In relation to that, the research is based on the validation of compliance in the giftedness assessments of schoolchildren by: teachers, parents, peers and schoolchildren's self-assessment.The research was conducted on 115 schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The instruments for giftedness assessment were based on the theory of multiple intelligences. The instruments passed several validations, and their metric characteristics were determined. The content validity has been established, and it shows in a high-quality manner that the measuring instrument provides the possibility of appropriate measurement of multiple intelligences, while the reliability of the instrument is confirmed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The positive correlation among the perceptions of teachers, schoolchildren, peers, and the self-assessment is confirmed by Pearson's correlation analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis test, with the Dunn's post-hoc test, indicates that there is a high congruence between the assessments of all four groups of assessors. The greatest agreement in assessments was found in musical intelligence, whereas the greatest differences in assessments were detected in the combination of parents with other assessors. The findings in this research will be used for creating a software for giftedness assessment. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to find out effects of strength-based self-determination training by multiple intelligences properties on socially adaptive behavior of students with intellectual disabilities. To achieve these goals, the subjects of this study were 80 students with intellectual disabilities who are attending elementary, middle special classes and special schools in Busan. They were considered with their background variables (chronological age, gender, mental age, and social maturity age). To find out differences by groups(experimental, control), grades (elementary, middle), and gender(male, female), after a post-test was carried out to estimate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation), three-way ANOVA was performed to see significance or interactive effects of the mean difference among their levels of experimental variables. The conclusions of this study are as follows; strength-based self-determination training by multiple intelligences properties had positive effects on socially adaptive behavior. The experimental group showed higher mediating effects than the control group; students in the middle schools had greater effects than those in the elementary schools; and females showed a higher level of achievement than males. As suggested in the conclusions, strength-based self-determination training by multiple intelligences properties is effective in improving socially adaptive behavior of students with intellectual disabilities. To include students with intellectual disabilities successfully and substantially into communities, through the improvement of socially adaptive behavior, it is therefore necessary to steadily develop and apply more systematic and specific self-determination training programs usable at home, at school, and in communities on the basis of strength intelligence reflecting their requirements and characteristics of students with intellectual disabilities. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to more systematically understand students with art underachievement by analyzing the multiple intelligence characteristics of a group of students with art underachievement. Gardner's Multiple Intelligence test was conducted on 196 students in grades 3-6 of Elementary School. Among them, a group of 12 students with art underachievement was selected through the art subject performance evaluation results and art expression ability test. The multi-intelligence characteristics of the art underachievement student group, the general student group, and the art gifted group were compared. As a result of the analysis, it was confirmed that the multiple intelligences of the student group with art underachievement were ‘normal’ in all types. Spatial intelligence was ranked the lowest, and interpersonal intelligence was the highest. These results contrast with the multi-intelligence characteristics of the art gifted, and in the case of the art gifted, spatial intelligence ranks highest and interpersonal intelligence ranks lowest. The implications of the study results are as follows. First, in the concept of art underachievement student, it has been proven in terms of multiple intelligences that art underahcievement targets students with basic potential. Second, when comparing the level of multiple intelligences of the art gifted group and the art underachievement group, it can be inferred that it directly affects the art ability of spatial intelligence. Third, by analyzing spatial intelligence in terms of structure, it is possible to prepare an effective plan for overcoming the art achievement in consideration of the art development of elementary school students. },

Japanese parents' self-estimates were somewhat lower than those found in the Western populations but males (fathers) rated their own overall g score and seven Gardner multiple intelligences, significantly higher than did females (mothers). There were few sex differences, however, when parents rated sons or daughters. Parents' own IQ estimate was the best predictor of the first (eldest) child's estimated IQ. A regression analysis indicated that the best predictors of self-estimated overall g intelligence were self-estimated verbal and numeric intelligences. Children's age and sex, and parents' age and sex, were all non-significant predictors of the overall g score estimates of the first two children. There were no sex differences in experience of, or attitudes towards, intelligence testing. A number of cultural differences were found compared with other studies in Western cultures. },

Data from 74 students who completed both the MBTI and multiple intelligences tests were analyzed using chi-square tests. Results showed extroverts (E) identified interpersonal intelligence as their strength, while introverts (I) also highlighted intrapersonal intelligence (χ = 14.704, p = .012). Thinking types (T) showed strength in intrapersonal intelligence, and Feeling types (F) in interpersonal intelligence (χ = 22.186, p = .000). Regarding weaknesses, Thinking types (T) reported naturalist intelligence, and Feeling types (F) noted logical-mathematical intelligence (χ = 15.841, p = .027). The study recommends tailored training: extroverted teachers focusing on collaboration, introverted teachers on individualized guidance, and Feeling types on stress management. Experiential learning is advised to strengthen naturalist and bodily-kinesthetic intelligences, improving overall teacher effectiveness. },

Because of it, a creative teaching-learning method is continuously mentioned for cultivation of creative talent. Recently, creativeness, approach centered on learners and self-directed learning all of which are being emphasized in educational circles strongly indicate that each individual needs to aggressively introduce their own multiple intelligence profiles for teaching-learning process. It is the very Multiple Intelligence Theory developed by Howard Gardner that has suggested a new direction for education. He not only defined the human intelligence as standardized and single intelligence from the cognitive viewpoint but also categorized it into the total 8 fields intelligences. Howard Gardener points out that if the nature of children’s multiple intelligence can be found from early childhood and the individual education appropriate to it is to be carried out the so-called whole-rounded education respecting their interest and egos will be accomplished and those children receiving the education will grow to adults with their own competitiveness in the future. Through design education among children’s learning domains, children can find out the designs which are everywhere in our daily lives, explore the possibility of various expressions and have both convergent and divergent thoughts. Accordingly, the design education is an excellent teaching medium to make children expand the width of thought and cultivate the logic thought. Thus, for this study, a program for children’s design activities by applying Multiple Intelligence Theory will be made to figure out what influence it will have on children’s multiple intelligences. },

  abstract={ It is evident that English classes in Thailand are overcrowded, as students frequently come from diverse backgrounds and have a variety of skills and interests. In response to this out-of-control circumstance, Howard Gardner's multiple intelligence (MI) theory proposes a new style of teaching that accounts for individual differences. This study seeks to investigate 1) the effects of MI-based instruction on English achievement and 2) the extent to which MI-based instruction fosters learner autonomy (LA). A quasi-experimental design was used to assess students' language achievement, while mixed-method research was used to assess students' LA. This study included 123 engineering faculty members from a university in the central region of Thailand. The English achievement test was used to assess their general English proficiency, while the adapted questionnaire from Murase's (2015) Measuring Instruments of Language Learner Autonomy (MILLA), the semi-structured interviews and the teacher's log were used to assess their LA. The results showed that the experimental group improved their listening, speaking, reading, writing and grammar skills, while their writing skills did not differ from the control group. There was no significant difference in the students' level of LA after the MI-based instruction. },

The optimal multi-dimensional evaluation solution of English MOOCS autonomous learning is obtained by the theory of multiple intelligences. The optimal classification surface of English MOOCS autonomous learning is obtained by Lagrange function, and the multi-dimensional dynamic evaluation matrix is obtained by binary tree. This paper uses Euclidean distance binary tree support vector machine (DBT-SVM) multi class classification algorithm to evaluate English MOOCS learning. The experimental results show that the multi-dimensional dynamic evaluation of autonomous learning takes the least time, only 4.2 s, and the accuracy rate of multi-dimensional dynamic evaluation is as high as 97%. },

Especially since 1980’s, it is prominent that the American music education theories haveinfluenced on the Korean music education significantly. Thus, it is meaningful to investigatethe research projects conducted abroad, and their possibilities of being adopted in Koreaneducational situation.Project Zero, a research group at Harvard Graduate School of Education, is known forits project, ‘Arts PROPEL’ in Korea. Considering the number, diversity, and influence of itsresearch projects, Project Zero is worthwhile to be studied for the sake of the developmentof Korean music education.Project Zero was founded at Harvard Graduate School of Education by philosopher,Nelson Goodman in 1967. The ultimate goal of the group was to research and improve artseducation. Goodman believed that learning arts is a process of cognitive activity. The mainactivity of the first period(1967-1974) of Project Zero was the discussion and investigation ofphilosophical issues of arts education in cognitive point of view. In his book Languages ofArt, which was a philosophical foundation of Project Zero, Goodman insists that the makingand perception of art are thought of as producing and perceiving symbols in the symbolsystems depending on the art media. After David Goodman resigned, Howard Gardner andDavid Perkins served as co-director of Project Zero from 1972 to 2000. In the secondperiod(1972-1983) of Project Zero’s history, the projects were focused on empirical researchesin cognitive and developmental psychology. While the focus of the Project Zero’s researcheswas still on art, there was an increasing interest in other issues such as problem solving,critical thinking, and brain organization. In the third period(1983-1993), the group turned theirdirection toward education. Project Zero began to apply their researches to the real world ofeducation. The representative projects during this period are Arts PROPEL and ProjectSpectrum. In the forth period (1993-present), Project Zero got matured in its structure,management, and size. The group also expanded the range of research. Projet Zero conductedresearch projects in the field of understanding, multiple intelligences, thinking, arts education,assessment, school improvement, and learning in out-of-school setting. },

Before outlining and discussing the results of classroom applications of the poetry lesson plans, this article provides a brief outline of the theoretical foundations of Howard Gardner’s Multiple Intelligences theory. The researcher designed The poetry lesson plans that tackle seven intelligences, which were used with three classes (Classes A, B, and C) during the 8th week of the semester.The result of study showed that using the stimulus material of poetry combined with MI directed activities is highly effective in promoting student involvement in the class. Choice-based activities in after-reading activities were instrumental in increasing the relevance and meaning of lessons and reducing teacher directedness.Participating students could practice four skills of English: reading, writing, listening and speaking and most of them indicated after taking the MI poetry classes that they thought that poetry should be included in EFL curricula. It is a notable result because many people think that poetry is too difficult to approach or is uninteresting to EFL/ESL students. However, this study shows that if teachers and material developers cultivate appropriate activities using proper poems, poetry can be useful and interesting material in the EFL classroom. },

  abstract={ The problem undertaken in this study is to examine the concept of “multiple intelligence” developed by Howard Gardner in his major inquiries, especially in relation to education. The purpose is to bring a distinctive approach to the position adopted here that Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences bears directly or indirectly on current matters of importance to educators and merits attention in order to improve our understanding of human life.The inquiry proceeds in two stages. The first stage is an exposition of the distinctions and relations necessary to Gardner’s concept of multiple intelligences. It proceeds by considering a threefold concept of human intelligence proposed by Gardner:intelligence as diverse, intelligence as cultural, intelligence as flexible. By intelligence as diverse, Gardner represents the complex and various capabilities of a human being. By intelligence as cultural, Gardner seeks light upon the capacities to solve problems or create products that are valuable in a cultural setting. By intelligence as flexible, Gardner proposes the changing concept of intelligence that is one of the most liberating forces in human life.The second stage is an educational discussion of the above three distinctive qualities of Gardnerian intelligence. Some implications of Gardner’s theory of education are:that since intelligence is not subject to one and the same entity, education is a close encounter with ‘Otherness’ in the human relation between ‘I’ and ‘you’; that since intelligence is activated in a cultural setting, education should create a life-embedding space where the emphasis is to be placed on the development of practical learning capability more than just knowledge; that since intelligence is flexible, education is ever subject to great changes that continually let us grow and thus become a human being in the truest sense of the term.This study concludes with a hopeful stance that education is a human activity whose goal is to fully realize one’s potentials. With this in mind, Gardner’s multiple intelligence theory behooves contemporary educators to acknowledge their conjoint interests in re-conceptualizing education as a way of life in a humane space, focused more on Existence. },

  abstract={ This study examines the reflection of activity types and the distribution of multiple intelligences in the context of classroom activities in eight textbooks revised in 2015 for High School Japanese I. The results indicate the need to review and supplement the content of learner-centered activity education in the textbooks. First, the analysis of the types of activities covered in the eight textbooks revised in 2015 shows that group activities (48%) and individual activities (33.3%) are predominant. In particular, textbook B shows a high bias towards group activities at 87.5%, suggesting the need to further diversify activities. Secondly, the analysis of the types of activities in the eight textbooks shows that experiential activities (26.7%) and games (25.3%) have the highest proportions, with production activities (14.7%) and songs (12%) also showing significant representation. However, project activities show the lowest reflection at 2.7%, indicating a need for future improvements to strengthen learner-centred lesson design through enhanced project activities. Third, the analysis of the distribution of multiple intelligences in the textbooks shows an overall average of 62.3%. Specifically, textbooks G (71.9%) and H (70.3%) show high levels of reflection, while other textbooks generally show reflection levels below the average. In terms of the distribution of multiple intelligences, ① Linguistic has the highest reflection rate at 98.6%, while ② Logical-Mathematical (36.8%), ⑤ Musical (18.1%), and ⑧ Naturalistic (8.8%) have reflection rates significantly lower than the overall average. These results suggest a concentration of textbook activities in specific areas of multiple intelligences, highlighting the need to rethink educational directions and balance the consideration of different intelligences. Finally, it is important for the development of communicative competence that instructional activities encompass a variety of multiple intelligences that can be expanded upon. While it may not be necessary for every activity in each unit to cover all of the multiple intelligences, it is hoped that by addressing intelligences not covered in one unit in other units, learners will have a balanced learning experience that provides them with opportunities for diverse activities. },

  abstract={ Development and dissemination of innovative pedagogies continues to be one of the challenges of the 21st century. The visible deficiencies in the educational field have highlighted the need for other types of pedagogies that promote complete student development. Gardner's theory about multiple intelligences (MIs) has great potential that has not yet been realised in practice in school contexts. With this research we aimed to analyse the relationship between the intelligences that students develop in primary education and the increase in certain cognitive and academic capacities, and to demonstrate that a pedagogy based on Gardner's theory does more to promote creativity, maturation and school performance than traditional teaching-learning pedagogies. A total of 420 participants from 2 state-funded schools participated in this study (experimental group = EG; control group = CG). The EG (n = 230) was taught using Gardner's theory and the CG (n = 190) was taught according to traditional pedagogy. There was an association between the intelligences developed by the students and their academic, creative, and maturational levels. Finally, significant differences were found between the EG and CG, with the EG obtaining a higher mean in the variables analysed in favour of the EG. In conclusion, using MIs in classrooms allows for a more mature and creative development and greater academic performance. },

A hermeneutical research method was employed in the study. The result of the exegesis led to a clear relationship between Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) and Paul’s concept of different gifts (DG). Both Paul and Gardner have the same understanding of intelligence as being diverse rather than unitary. Gardner approached the subject matter from a psychological and biological perspective, while Paul approached it from a religious and spiritual perspective. They attempted to help people understand the true nature of intelligence or gift. },

  abstract={ When practicing high-quality leader-member exchange (LMX) theory, the leader's ability to communicate, build and maintain relationships is a vital part. Because leader-member exchange theory is a relationship-based approach to leadership that primarily includes social exchange and communication on a daily basis, we can highlight linguistic intelligence as a key leadership skill that is part of the multiple intelligences defined by Howard Gardner. The goal of this article was to conduct research into organizations where the leader applies LMX theory and examine whether the leader's linguistic intelligence is positively related to the quality of the leader-member exchange. The dependent variable was the quality of the LMX. We were able to recruit 39 employees and 13 leaders. Correlations and multiple regressions were used to analyze our statement. The overall results are statistically significant and we conclude that there is a high positive correlation between LMX and linguistic intelligence in the organizations that were part of this study. A limitation of this study is the use of purposive sampling, which resulted in a relatively small sample size and may limit the generalization of the results to other populations. },

With the purpose of searching for the consistency and structure of artistic giftedness, I sampled both gifted students and accomplished artists through the recommendation, random and screening of those population. Especially, accomplished artist group has been selected from the criteria as; prize winners of prestigious art award, professors of art college, significant artists whose art works being traded high price in the art market and artists who are assessed creative by critics. The results of the study as belows;First, the multiple intelligences profiles of accomplished artists and the gifted show laser-profile with extremely high spatial intelligence(leading intelligence), and with second level of intra personal intelligence and naturalistic intelligence(supporting intelligence). Secondly, the profiles of gifted students are greatly different from other students major in visual arts and ordinary students not major in visual art. This trait of MI profile is closely correlated with the one of accomplished artists. Third, with this result, giftedness in visual art is the consistent concept which is not divided according to age. Giftedness in visual art is not the phenomenological matter which appeared all of sudden at a special stage, rather the evidence-based-experiential concept. Therefore, MI theory is the efficient and meaningful way to explain the phenomena and to develop the model of giftedness in art. },

The participants were 54 elementary students selected through a game addiction test in Incheon City, Korea. We tested the students’ MI to facilitate program development. the students with gaming addiction showed strengths in the Bodily-kinesthetic, Naturalist, and Spatial intelligences whilst showing weaknesses in the Logical-mathematical, Intrapersonal, and Interpersonal intelligences as opposed to normal students who had opposite results. We arranged the program around various gaming and playing activities to engage their stronger intelligences; we added activities to address their weakness (i.e., Logical-mathematical, Intrapersonal, and Interpersonal intelligences). This study has shown that this program lowered the game immersion level of the students and was helpful in turning their attention to other activities. There were significant differences between pretest and posttest game addiction scores (p<0.001). Their weekly gaming time and computer usage decreased rapidly. Satisfaction with the game addiction therapy program based on MI was very high. },

  abstract={ The intelligence means the ability that man can solve the problems that he faces, and can adapt himself his environment that he faces. The psychologists of the traditional side insist a single intelligence and any other intellectual power formed by a single intelligence. But the ones of the other side insist the multiple Intelligences and a theory that the intelligence is composed of many elements which can be separated.Howard Gardner insist 8½ or 9 Multiple Intelligences plualized, adding to a single intelligence what the traditionalists excluded. His theory of 8½ or 9 multi-Intelligences are as follows: there are ❶ Musical Intelligence operated by the right cerebral hemisphere, ❷ Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence operated by the contralateral side and the kinesthetic cortex of each hemisphere, ❸ Logical-Mathematical Intelligence which the logical is operated by the side of the frontal lobe and calculating a number is operated by the parietal lobe, ❹ Linguistic Intelligence which understanding the process dealt with language is operated by the center of right side of the cerebral cortex, the grammatical sentences is operated by Broca and understanding speech or speaking is operated by Wernike. ❺ Spatial Intelligence operated by the back side of the right cerebral cortex, ❻ Interpersonal Intelligence operated by the frontal lobe, ❼ Intrapersonal Intelligence operated by the frontal lobe, ❽ Naturalist Intelligence operated by the occipital lobe and temporal lobe, and ❾ Existencialist(or Spiritual) Intelligence operated by the special domain of the temporal lobe and the lobe of the lower part.Gardner said that a child is not born with the equal qualities of his 8½ Multiple Intelligences, but born with the different qualities. He emphasized the continuous and vital interaction between a gene and an environment begun from the moment of the pregnancy for the development of the intelligence. He also said the developmental theory that a child’s intelligence shall be developed only when a child’s effort, the educational environment, the support of his parents and the society as well are cooperated,I tried to prepare the music educational program so that the development of Gardner’s 8½ Multiple Intelligences might be reached the maximum. And then I applied it to the children(4-7years of age) for 3years through team-teaching, using the practicale method that the children, the teacher and the parents can cooperate in the classroom.The children that participated in this program had not have the regular music education. Their musical experiences were what they have gotten from their mother’s songs and their environments naturally. I figured it, thinking of the achievement of learning(100 marks) as the development of the intelligence(100%). Then I put their developments for one year into form of a diagram as follows: [표] The children of H group and O group got the best result among the groups. They worked hard for their home-work with their parents in the good educational environment. The children of R group did not reach at the level of their learning goals. Generally They didn’t work hard for their home-work and their parent didn’t give the good support for their children’s learning during the term. The domains which the children didn’t make their own effort and their parent didn’t give support show the lower numerical value. The children of S group and E group show the very lower average mark. They have the weakness that they did not only fully developed psychologically and physically, but also did not work hard themselves, and didn’t have the parent’s support. The above diagram shows Gardner’s developmental theory that the learning of a child will be progressed to the highest degree. and the intelligences of a child will be developed to the highest degree, Only when the best educational environment, child’s own best effort and the best support of his parents are cooporated, as the intelligence is developed by learning in the continuous interaction between a gene and an environment begun from the moment of the pregnancy. },

The sample was 304 students of Pedagogy in Physi-cal Education from two universities in the city of Santiago de Chile, to which the Inventory of Self-efficacy for Multiple Intelligences Revised (IAMI-R) was applied. The results reveal that the 43-item AMI-R contains the eight factors associated with the eight multiple abilities, which explained 65,502% of the total variance. Cronbach's alpha gives a value of .891 for the instrument. In the sample, the highest score was obtained in kinesthetic ability, followed by interpersonal. In contrast, naturalistic ability scored lowest. More studies are needed to confirm these results in other study houses and other regions of the country. },

In this study, classroom teachers evaluated students and labeled the top two students excellentbased on academic performance and behavior. For this study, 159 excellent children and 1359 general children from 1st grade to 6th grade were surveyed from elementary schools of Seoul, Incheon, Kangwon, Kyunggi and Chungnam in Korea. The measurement tools are as follows: Questionnaire to ask children of future career plans and their preferred play activities, and MIDAS-kids(Multiple Intelligences Development Assessment Scale for kids) standardized in Korea. The results of this study are as followings: First, excellent children had different MI profiles than those of general children. Compared to excellent children, the MI profiles of general children are affected more by size of the city, grade level, and gender. Second, excellent children preferred play activities related to linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences regardless of their MI strengths. On the contrary,general children preferred play activities related to their own MI strengths. Last,excellent children did not have big differences from general children in their future career plans. However, compared with excellent children, general children tend to want to have future careers more related to their MI strengths.The relationship between these tendencies and the quality of the students' future needs to be explored in further studies. For the self-realization and fulfillment, excellent children need to be encouraged to pay more attention to their preferences and interests. },

Whereas his theory is very popular (especially among developmental and educational psychologists) it has been somewhat harshly criticized by researchers from the perspective of psychological assessment. The main points of criticism are in regard to Gardner's assertion of MIs' independence from the general intelligence g factor , the domain specificity of MI, the assessment procedures of MI, and the inadequate empirical validation of attempts to implement MI theory into educational practice. This article reviews the statistical meaning of the g factor and data from biological psychology.

  abstract={ The progress of neuroeducation in recent years has had an impact on the current understanding of education. As an interdisciplinary science, neuroeducation has provided great advantages over the description of neural correlates in the teaching-learning process, as well as in the detection of neuromyths. However its contributions are not lacking in a critical review from a philosophical perspective that goes beyond the purely neuroscientific questioning of the validity of the evidence. The main objective of this article is to point out the necessary critical acceptance of the neuroeducation results in order to avoid a neuroscientific colonialism as a challenge that educational theory must face up to.Firstly we will justify the introduction of neuroeducation in the current educational landscape. Secondly we will conceptualize neuroeducation and neuromyths in order to later on, through an argumentative and critical methodology, analyze the factors behind the acceptance of its discoveries. Thirdly, the Multiple Intelligences theory of H. Gardner will be analyzed in order to exemplify these factors. This analysis will allow us to observe how neuroscientific evidence or lack of them is not always sufficient to consider an educational theory pejoratively as a neuromyth. The discussion lies in the consideration of a lack of scientific evidence from the interdisciplinary dialogue of neuroeducation. Despite of the open debate on its neuroscientific and on its usefulness at the pedagogical level, Multiple Intelligences theory are in tune with the considerations of educational laws in recent years, which have had a significant impact on learning competencies, and on methodologies and evaluations that understand the human being from a holistic point of view, thus opening the door to dialogue with other sciences. },

The study was conducted in 2015 with an empirical sample of 1,262 students aged 11 to 15. A vast majority of these students (86.9%) played digital games regularly. Early adolescent females spent on average 8.7 h per week playing digital games, while males spent an average of about 17.7 h per week playing digital games. Students with higher scores in Interpersonal intelligence section spent more time playing digital games, while those with higher scores in Visual/spatial and Natural intelligences section played less. Most of the students (41.6%) played digital games longer than five years. Early adolescent males favored Arcade and Sports games, while females preferred Logic, Online and Adventure game genres. Arcade (Action/Shooter/Platform) and Adventure games were preferably played by students with higher scores in Logical/mathematical intelligence, and Sports (Fighting) games were preferably played by students with higher scores in Bodily/kinesthetic intelligence. Strategy games were a preferred genre for students with lower scores in Musical/rhythmic intelligences. These findings support the notion that individual psychological characteristics lead to media selection and behavioral patterns construction. Vice versa, playing the preferred game genre will probably further motivate players to enhance the specific set of skills, strategies and habits. },

  abstract={ This paper aims to clarify what is the principle of excellence in education. There are two kinds of competing versions on excellence, i.e. the psychological and the philosophical versions.In the psychological version, I first critically examine Howard Gardner's idea of excellence such as extraordinariness which is formulated under the name of Multiple Intelligences Theory. According to the theory, excellence denotes individual's diverse competences related to the specific areas of jobs. But it is not regarded as a universal capacity all humans have. This theory has the problem that the criteria of classicfication on diverse ‘intelligences’ can not cover all abilities all individuals have. This problem results from treating the excellence like an empirical concept in the theory. Secondly I propose my interpretation on Plato's arete in Republic as an alternative version on excellence. In his system, excellence is described as a single human nature in which all humans participate, i.e. arete. 'Philosopher-King' indicates the ultimate stage of human nature or the educated person.Education is essentially considered to be good as an expedience to realize human nature. The intrinsic aim of education advocates a single excellence, and this aim is not fundamentally different from the aim Christianity pursues. },

The relationship between creativity and intelligence has been a matter of debate as has the role of MI theory in gifted education. An extensive array of neuroscience evidence is reviewed as it pertains to the validity of MI theory. Data are presented that describe neural architectures for a proposed new category of Cognitive Qualities that includes Creative Cognition, Esthetic Judgement, and Insight/Intuition. The implications for understanding the minds of gifted individuals with the goal of personalizing instruction to maximize achievement and life development are reviewed. Five key principles drawn from educational cognitive neuroscience are proposed as guidelines for using MI theory to enhance instruction and inspire curriculum design to account for the unique cognitive qualities of gifted and talented individuals. },

Data is presented on the increasing incidence of anxiety in adolescence and the limits of commonly applied therapies. Adolescence is characterised as a time of turbulence and change, and the issues that adolescent clients bring to counselling are diverse and often complex. Evidence from several studies in counselling have shown positive outcomes through linking multiple intelligences and expressive therapies as an integrative therapy. The potential benefits of applying this combined approach to secondary school students are discussed. },

  abstract={ In school cartography, it is possible to develop resources linked to lived spaces through the theory of multiple intelligences (MI), developed by Howard Gardner. Thus, the main purpose of this research was to identify the contribution of Gardner's theory, considering the use of geotechnologies, to the construction of geographic / cartographic knowledge in Elementary School. First, a review of the literature was written focusing on the concepts of MI and school cartography. Then, a questionnaire was applied to the students in order to evaluate their academic prior knowledge. Next, an educational workshop was held, where thematic notions were presented to the students for their interpretation of cartographic documents and mapping. After that, the students made two maps (one analogue, one digital), which contributed to mobilize the students' range of intelligences. Finally, a second questionnaire was applied to the students in order to check what, in terms of knowledge, they had acquired. In conclusion, one can highlight that the theory of MI allows the development of student-centred activities, thus contributing to greater success in the teaching-learning process. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to analyze the developmental characteristics and trend between multiple intelligences (MI) and career maturity (CM). To achieve the aim of the study, the total number of 1107 subjects from elementary, middle, and high school was asked to take MI and career maturity test and the results were analyzed. The methodology to analyze the results were independent t-test, ANOVA, and multiple regression analysis. The findings were as followings: Firstly, considering the MI profiles of children and adolescents, intrapersonal intelligence and interpersonal intelligence tend to be high in both parties. Secondly, as the subjects grow older, the weakness in MI profile is inclined to be compensated. Thirdly, the difference between high and low intelligences tends to be decreased while individual difference within each intelligence to be increased. Fourthly, sex-related differences in MI and CM are maintained constantly in every phase as they are getting older. Concerning MI, male students showed their strength in logical-mathematical intelligence whereas female students in musical intelligence. They also acquired higher score in preparation of career, career concern, and information processing than male students in each level of elementary, middle, and high school. Fifthly, CM shows steeper decline in the phase of adolescence than childhood. Lastly, in every stage of the development, MI and CM show positive correlation and MI explains over 35% of CM. All the students showed especially high correlation with intrapersonal intelligence as the factor that influences on their career perception in each level of school. },

  abstract={ In this comprehensive study, we explore the intersection between Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory and Islamic educational systems, employing bibliometric tools like Descriptive analysis and Author Network Visualization to reveal the intricate contours of academic collaboration and research in this domain. An increasing trend in publications and cross-cultural collaborations, particularly involving the United States, Indonesia, and Turkey, underscores the global relevance of integrating modern psychological theories like MI with Islamic education. Through citation and keyword analysis, we highlight a significant divergence between research on Islamic schools and MI, as well as an emerging interest in applying MI in religious educational contexts. Furthermore, our research identified a seriously alarming gap in the academic literature at this intersection, emphasizing the need for future exploration. In synthesizing the findings, we conclude that the fusion of MI with Islamic pedagogy offers a robust approach to holistic learning in recognizing individual intelligence domains and fostering growth. The integration of these two fields promises to redefine education by melding traditional religious teachings with contemporary insights, creating a pathway for enhanced student understanding, progressive policy formulation, and innovative pedagogical strategies. },

The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis. The models compared were: a) a model with six first-order uncorrelated factors, b) a model with six first-order factors and one second-order general factor, g; c) a model with two correlated second-order general factors, in which the cognitive intelligences load on a cognitive general factor and the non-cognitive intelligences load on a non-cognitive general factor, and d) a model with six first-order correlated factors. The percentage of variance in measured abilities due to g and to first-order factors was also estimated. Overall, the results indicate that the Spectrum activities are not as separate from g as proposed by the defenders of multiple intelligences theory, nor as unitary as argued by the defenders of g factor models.

  abstract={ The key for students of today to become independent learners and knowledge workers of tomorrow lies in being information literate. However, existing information literacy (IL) teaching approaches have not always been successful in equipping students with these crucial skills to ensure deep erudition and long-lasting retention. Hence, sound pedagogical approaches become critical in IL education. This research hypothesizes that students grasp IL skills more effectively when their innate interests, such as that determined by their respective dominant intelligences, are stimulated and applied to their work. Consequently, they would produce work of better quality. To verify these postulations, an IL course was designed for students undertaking project work to equip them with the necessary IL skills, by using an established pedagogical approach - Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Subsequently the quality of students' project work between the experimental and control groups were compared. It was found that the performance of students who had undergone IL training through the application of learning styles was superior in their project work. },

Project Spectrum helped to find in which domains each child had strength and/or weakness. Most children had some strength or weakness and showed relative strong and weak domains on a personal level. The study also showed that performances of children in domains of strength compared with domains of no strength/weakness and weakness were characterized by 'easy to engage', 'confident', 'focused', 'persistent' and 'reflective on own work'. It was concluded that identification and development of children's strengths is one of the most effective and desirable ways to get children to have positive working styles.

The study was conducted in three child development centers located in three areas: one peasant, one indigenous and one urban. A qualitative method with phenomenological design based on the application of semi-structured interviews, observation techniques and analysis of educational planning was applied to understand how the intelligences in each environment are conceived, and also to understand the teaching strategies applied by teachers, the intelligences that are favored according to the socio-cultural characteristics and training objectives. The results indicate that intelligences are associated directly with the social and cultural conditions of communities, so that from the earliest years some of them are fostered in classrooms and others are restricted. This perspective allows us to reflect, strategize and pose more comprehensive training processes that consider not only local needs and expectations but also prepare for a world in constant transformation and equip early childhood education with more diversity. },

To accomplish the purpose, CEP model based on MIT was projected and a CEP was developed according to the process of educational program development process, ADDIE, that is, analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The 154 second grade middle school students from four classes participated in this program during the discretional times and extra curricula activity times by dividing them into two groups, treatment group and controlled one. The result of effect analysis for the verification of the validity of the program treatment can be presented into two divided ways of achievement and satisfaction analysis as followings: concerning the result on the analysis of effect, the pretest score of CRT increased significantly after the treatment of the program. When compared to that of controlled group, the score of treatment group was significantly high in the area of reflecting, leveraging, and framing, which was appeared in the contents of students' reflection journal. Consequently, it can be said from subjects' answer to MI career questionnaire and reflection journal that MI CEP influenced positively on students' reflecting, leveraging, and framing. What's more, MI CEP helped students explore jobs or collect information in the view point of MI and in the long run gave positive impacts on students. The degree of their satisfaction was high and the method in which the program was practiced was acceptable to the students. This study is meaningful in that it is so representative a CEP that can be operated as the guide for further development of CEP which puts its concern on manifesting and enlightening one's potential. },

Since the M.I. theory is the most confidential and effective theory in the educational field, it is utterly important to bring this multi-dimensional notions to music community. 21st century’s intellectual literacy is correlated with integration, specifically, ‘Consilience: the unity of knowledge’ is discussed in many other areas already. In parallel, main topic of using synesthesia is discussed with piano pedagogy and M.I. theory simultaneously. This study attempts to develop the schemata based on combining road map of these three areas. The successful execution of this schemata depends on how the concept of synesthesia(theory of sense modality) is crystallized and links logically to the piano pedagogic issues and M.I. theory in the sense of ‘the unity of Knowledge.’ Sense modality and multiple intelligence modality are thoroughly presented with music reading, sign, bodily-kinesthetic movement, pattern recognition, interpretation, acoustics, expression, and finally the performance. },

The present study examines language learners' text comprehension through outlines, a popular CO, compared with text-only condition, and further investigates the effect of learner-constructed outlines (i.e., systematic note-taking) and expert-constructed outlines (i.e., readymade displays) on comprehension. Finally, the predictive power of multiple intelligences (MI) across different input modalities is scrutinized. Following stratified random sampling, a total of 111 EFL undergraduates were divided into text-only (receiving a text twice), expert-constructed (the text followed by an outline), and learner-constructed (the text followed by an outline to be drawn up by the learner) groups. A TOEFL examination, a 1218-word expository text on systematic sleep disorder, a follow-up reading comprehension test, and a multiple intelligences inventory constituted the data collection measures. The results of multiple regression and ANOVA were as follows: (a) COs lead to more content recall than text displays; (b) expert-constructed and learner-constructed outlines are equally effective; (c) MI significantly predicts the groups' reading comprehension; (d) interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences are significant correlates of text-only groups' performance; and (e) visual, verbal, and intrapersonal intelligences are significantly associated with learner-constructed groups' reading scores.

The possibility of identifying and classifying these abilities enables effective action to be taken to develop the most relevant MIs for the student according to their area of study. The aim of this article is to describe the use of the Hierarchical Process Analysis (HPA) method as a tool for classifying the level of attention to be given to each MI in a sample of higher education students. To do this, a questionnaire was used to survey the MIs of a sample of 500 students from a public higher education institution. The researchers then used the AHP to sort and classify the MIs in the sample. It was thus possible to conclude that the AHP can be used as a form of classification and evaluation for the theory of the MIs, helping to choose which MIs need a closer look and which do not need intervention. The limitations of the research were that it used only one multi-criteria analysis tool. Therefore, for future work, we intend to use the database obtained from the study and apply other multi-criteria analysis methodologies. },

  abstract={ ABSTR A C T Since Gardner suggested that human beings hold multiple intelligences, numerous teachers have adapted and incorporated the multiple intelligence theory (MIT) into their daily routine in the classroom. However, to date, the efficacy of MIT-inspired methodologies remains unclear. The focus of the present study was to perform a systematic review and a meta-analysis to assess the impact of these interventions on academic achievement through reading, maths, or science tests. The inclusion criteria for the review required that studies should es-timate quantitatively the impact of an MIT-based intervention on the academic performance and that they followed a pre-post design with a control group. The final sample included 39 articles comprising data from 3009 pre-school to high school students, with diverse levels of achievement, from 14 different countries. The results showed that the studies had important methodological flaws, like small sample sizes or lack of active control groups; they also reported insufficient information about key elements, such as the tools employed to measure the outcomes or the specific activities performed during training, and revealed signs of publication or reporting biases that impeded a valid evaluation of the efficacy of MIT applied in the classroom. The educational impli-cations of these results are discussed. },

  abstract={ This study aims at evaluating Top-Notch series through a checklist devised by the researchers based on the elements of the Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory proposed by Gardner (1998). With the shift from teacher-centered classrooms to learner-centered one, more and more research is/is needed to be done in the realm of students` need analysis. One of the undeniable needs of the students to be fulfilled is for them to learn through the intelligence they are most capable at while the educational system mainly addresses students` verbal intelligence. This study has evaluated Top Notch series in terms of taking the nine intelligences into consideration through answering these two questions: 1. To what extent does Top-Notch series represent the MI features? 2. How frequently each of the eight intelligences is used in each book of the series? The results confirm that Top Notch is rich in addressing verbal intelligence followed by the visual, logical, musical, interpersonal, bodily, and intrapersonal one while to some extent poor in representing natural and existential intelligences. It also shows that there exists a pattern of some of the intelligences-addressing through different levels, for example unlike visual intelligence, verbal-intelligence-addressing enhances as the books grow in level. The comparison of the results with that of Interchange series evaluation illustrated that Top Notch is more representative of the intelligences and that it is a suitable alternative to the Interchange in terms of addressing the elements of MI principles or as Lezear (1991) puts it Ways of Knowing. },

Participants (N = 200) estimated their own levels of the eight abilities, completed two maximum performance tests of each ability, and provided self-ratings of their personality characteristics. As observed in previous research, most participants tended to overestimate their levels of ability in most of the intelligence domains. Self-estimated ability levels were generally only modestly correlated with measured levels of the same ability, and tended to show equally strong correlations with personality variables. Sex differences were observed for self-estimates of some abilities, and these sex differences were largely independent of measured ability and personality. It was concluded that high levels of self-estimated ability were related to being male, having high measured ability, and being high in Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience, and low in Emotionality. },

Men's self-estimates were not significantly higher than women's on any of the 11 estimates. The results were in line with previous studies, in that both sexes rated the overall intelligence of their first male children higher than the first female children. Higher parental IQ self-estimates correspond with higher IQ estimates for children. Globally parents estimated that their sons had significantly higher IQs than their daughters. In particular, parents rated their son's spiritual intelligence higher than those of their daughters. Children's age and sex, and parents' age and sex were all non-significant predictors of the overall g score estimates of the first two children. Participants thought verbal, mathematical, and spatial intelligence were the best indicators of the overall intelligence for self and children. There were no sex differences in experience of, or attitudes towards, intelligence testing. Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the self-estimates of intelligence, as well as limitations of that approach. },

From this point of view this survey aimed on identifying differences in MI development of the Accountancy course, from Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Parana (UNIOESTE), Marechal Candido Rondon campus, in relation to the Courses of Administration, Geography, History and Language, as well as among the Accountancy different classes and genders, that justify. the proposition of specific teaching strategies for this course, its classes and genders., For the data analysis we have used the average percentage obtained from the MI, the ANOVA test and the Scheffe test. Analyses, indicated that the Accountancy course is different from the Languages course in relation to the logical-mathemaitical MI development; it also differs from the. History and Languages courses in relation to the M I linguistics development, and from the Geography Course in relation to the naturalist MI. Among the classes, differences we're found in the MI linguistics development in the second and fourth years, the interpersonal MI in the first and second years, and in the second and third years. There were no statistically significant differences as to the MI development between genders. It is Concluded that the course must stimulate the linguistics MI development through activities that involve reading, review, debates and seminars, and base its methods mainly in logical-mathematical MI through works with calculations and analyses or dynamics that require logical reasoning. },

  abstract={ The Enrichment Program for Cultivating Problem Solving Abilities and Multiple Intelligences for Gifted Preschoolers (PSMIGP program) was the first enrichment program for young gifted children in Taiwan. It was an extra-curricular program that was implemented over a 3-year period. The assessment and curriculum were designed by adapting the main part of the DISCOVER curriculum. The purpose of this paper was to introduce the identification model and to analyze the participants' performance in problem solving activities and in demonstrating their special talents. To offer enrichment services for gifted young children, the researchers developed an identification model to discover more young gifted children and serve their needs in learning, regardless of the nature of their talents, disabilities, or cultural or socio-economical status. All participating young children were screened in a three-stage process that included both objective and subjective assessments, including checklists, interviews, portfolio assessment, group intelligence tests, observation in the play corner, individual intelligence tests, and structured observation activities. It was also necessary to adjust the standardized test procedure to fit the needs of twice exceptional young children.In total there were sixty-one preschoolers participated in this three-year program, including eleven twice exceptional children and one child from a new immigrant home. Among these sixty-one preschoolers, eight of them participated in two years of the program; the others only participated in one year of the program. The results of this enrichment program found significant correlations among the measurement scores; the scores of teacher assessment of problem solving abilities also showed that most students performed well on all five kinds of problem solving types. From children's archives, participating children presented scientific thinking characteristics, such as rich knowledge with fascinating imagination and the ability to seek many approaches to solving problems. They were delighted to challenge others and pleased to be challenged. The twice exceptional children also performed well in the program, especially those children with autism whose progress in social skills and group adaptability were remarkable. In sum, the researchers in this program had a belief that children, whether gifted or not, did not get the satisfaction of making progress until they had opportunities to find and develop their potentials.

This paper first examines the writings of Howard Gardner, a cognitive scientist, and Elliot Eisner, an art educator, and then compares the art education programs overseen by them, Arts PROPEL and DBAE, Arts PROPEL based on Howard Gardner's works and DBAE based on Elliot Eisner's works through this influence of cognitive psychology is explored. Both oftheseartseducation programs use the rhetoric of cognitive science, yet close examination reveals these programs to be quite different.Recent DBAE experiments in art education are examined. Here the curriculum is offered in units, like domain projects. Production central, and instruction appears to grow from the student's own experience, like Arts PROPEL. Assessment, too, is more like Arts PROPEL, in that it is ongoing and in multiple forms. Portfolios are used for an assessment tool in the new DBAE experiments and elements of reflection and self-assessment appear. This dissertation concludes that the new DBAE experiments are actually more like Arts PROPEL and that Gardner's approach seems to be winning more favor than Eisner's. },

The study involved 276 participants from a university's business administration department, undergoing an international business course. A range of technology-based activities incorporating MI strategies was employed, exploring key topics such as globalization, corporate social responsibility, and market segmentation. Hypothesis testing revealed that high expectations and changes in viewpoints positively impacted self-concept, ability, and motivation, contributing to improved learning outcomes. The integration of technology in teaching facilitated these transformations, demonstrating how digital tools like virtual reality, interactive platforms, and online tutorials can enhance learning experiences. However, the effect on learning gain varied when viewpoints changed, indicating a need for further research into the differential impact of technology on learning outcomes. Despite some limitations, the study offers compelling evidence supporting the integration of MIs teaching strategy with technology-enriched environments in business administration education. Future studies should further explore the role of emerging technologies in this context. },

The current study explored college students’ attitude toward IQ, introduced the concepts of MI, and examined how their thinking has been changed qualitatively. The results showed that college student participants generally thought that intelligence is fixed, and hardly changes throughout lifespan. After introducing the eight components of MI, the student participants appeared to learn that there exist more intelligence than ‘logical-mathematical’ and ‘linguistic-verbal’ areas.

The study was intended to be exploratory in nature to generate hypotheses for future investigations. Data were collected using MS-CISSAR (Greenwood, Carta, Kamps, & Delquadri, 1997), a software program for gathering and analyzing observational data in classrooms. Results suggested that the experiences of the participants in both typical and MI-inclusive classrooms were more alike than different. Participants in both types of classrooms were engaged primarily in whole-class, independent seatwork, and traditional classroom activities, and were engaged less frequently in small groups or multiple response activities. However, participants were observed more frequently to be engaged in multiple response activities in MI classrooms, and in both noninstructional time and individual seatwork activities that were different from those of peers in typical classrooms. The participants in MI classrooms spent more time interacting with their typical peers, whereas those in typical classrooms spent more time interacting with adults during 1:1 activities that were different from those of their peers. The results are discussed in terms of their educational and research implications, limitations, and suggestions for further research. },

  abstract={ The current study explores possible correlation between learners' multiple intelligences and academic accomplishment for the university students who struggle for obtaining higher level of English skills. According to Gardner (1983), people need to recognize that there are many different facets of human cognition. Teachers who take multiple intelligences into account expand their repertory of teaching tools, techniques, and strategies beyond the typical linguistic and logical ones predominant in the ordinary classrooms. Multiple intelligences might supplement students' strengths and expand their possibilities. The researcher of this study tried to find out the answers to the following questions: what is the general profile of the Korean adult English learners'multiple intelligences?; what kind of correlational relationship might be identified between learners' multiple intelligences and academic accomplishment? Meaningful correlation was found in the increased accomplishment in terms of linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences. Musical intelligence was not as closely related with linguistic intelligences as Gardner suggested. As a pedagogical implication, multiple intelligences theory might enable teachers to develop diverse student-centered teaching methods and enhance positive teacher-student classroom interactions. },

The subjects were 122 5-year-old children. Eighty children were the gifted, and the other 42 were the ordinary. Two groups were clearly differentiated in terms of multiple intelligences and emotional intelligence. But, two kinds of creativity tests showed inconsistent differentiation results. Creativity from TTCT figural form showed clear distinction between two groups. A integrative-creativity questionnaire could not detect the differences between them. Three discriminant analyses were performed in order to deeply grasp the importance and the structure of multiple intelligences, emotional intelligence, and TTCT creativity in discriminating the gifted from the ordinary. },

  abstract={ This study aimed to corroborate the efficacy of classroom activities based on the theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI) by analyzing the learners' performance in a video project. Overseas classroom environments for Korean-language learning have faced manifold problems, such as lack of time for practice, large class sizes, and fewer exposures to the Korean language outside the classroom. Hence, classroom activities for Korean as a Foreign Language (KFL) learners should be designed to enhance Korean-language communication skills more effectively and efficiently. Classroom activities based on the MI theory are known to be motivational and effective for foreign-language acquisition, but their specific effectiveness on KFL learning has not been investigated yet. To examine the efficacy of MI activities on KFL learners, the performance in a final video project of an experimental group that had received more types of MI activities throughout one semester was compared with that of a control group. During the semester, the experimental group was more actively engaged in seven types of MI activities, while the control group had four kinds of limited MI activities. The results of the video project show that the experimental group created scenarios and videos in a significantly better way than the control group. This suggests that more various classroom MI activities mobilized learners' MI and enhanced their problem-solving skills to complete a comprehensive task in a KFL classroom. },

It also aimed to design and apply classes of curriculum integration with the multiple intelligences theory applied and to investigate their effects on children's creative thinking. As a result, classes of curriculum integration where the multiple intelligences theory was applied turned out to have positive impacts on the development of elementary school students' creative thinking. In particular, the effects were verified in such subelements of creative thinking as language understanding, language inference, logical thinking, understanding of figures, visual discrimination, and sensory coordination. But the effects were not proved with the element of abstract thinking, mathematical thinking, visual memory, and auditory memory. The results confirmed the possibility of curriculum integration with the multiple intelligences theory applied being presented as an alternative of curriculum integration overcoming the existing limitations of the multiple intelligences theory and the problems with curriculum integration. Furthermore, since the practice of curriculum integration with the multiple intelligences theory applied suggested in the study is an example, the teacher should take the characteristics of his or her students and subjects and the types of curriculum integration into account in reorganizing such a class. },

This is a retrospective, longitudinal descriptive study, which reviewed 113 information registries of mothers participating in a traditional educational intervention and 104 mothers with intervention based on multiple intelligences, evaluating the level of knowledge and exclusive maternal breastfeeding practices through observation visits. Results. The intervention based on multiple intelligences achieved greater cost-effectiveness than the traditional intervention given that with lower investment, it managed to get 56.73% of the mothers to increase their knowledge and 68.27% to practice exclusive maternal breastfeeding from six months to more months in comparison with the traditional intervention in which 41.59% and 43.36% improved, respectively. Moreover, for its effective application, on every 100 mothers, its investment would result lower than the traditional program. Conclusion. Upon applying satisfactorily the cost-effectiveness evaluation, as model to compare educational interventions on exclusive maternal breastfeeding, better results were determined with the intervention based on multiple intelligences compared with the traditional intervention, given that with lower investment, it was possible to benefit a greater number of mothers in their level of knowledge and practices of maternal breastfeeding. },

The theoretical and empirical data set that academic performance would be associated with novel variables, such as: being the first family member to start university studies and self-perceived ability; nevertheless, the evidence available regarding this relationship is still sparse and contradictory, even more if we consider that the evaluated group comes mainly from families with parents who do not have university training. From a quantitiative approach, we applied the TMMS-24 scale for assessing self-perceived emotional intelligence and MIDAS-teens to evaluate the perception of multiple intelligences scale; the results reveal weak correlations between academic performance and intelligences: linguistic, logical-mathematical, as well as an inverse correlation with the attention branch of emotional intelligence; in this way, it shows no correlation with the other dimensions of emotional intelligence and multiple intelligences. Using multiple regression analysis we state that it is not possible to explain the variance in academic performance from the perception of intelligence mentioned. The question related to the actual effect of the selfassessment of the own abilities in academic performance remains open, as does the effect of the valuation methods used in various subject areas regarding these results. },

Parents (n = 120) also estimated the intelligence of their children. Men's self-estimates were significantly higher than women's (110.15 vs. 104,84). Participants thought their verbal, mathematical, and spatial intelligence scores were the best indicators of their own overall intelligence. Parents estimated that their sons had significantly higher IQs than their daughters (115.21 vs. 107,49). Self-estimates and estimates of children's multiple intelligences were higher for men and sons, significantly so for logical-mathematical and spatial intelligence. Parents rated 2nd-born daughters as having significantly higher verbal and musical intelligence than their male counterparts. Higher parental IQ self-estimates corresponded with higher IQ estimates for children. Results for 1st-born children were clearest and showed the most significant differences. The findings are interpreted in terms of sociocultural and familial influences and the possibility of actual sex differences in particular abilities. },

To achieve the purpose of this study, the tests were conducted by using the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument and MIDAS for undergraduate students.The results of this study as follows ; first, the brain dominance thinking types was significantly positively correlated to the multiple intelligences. Therefore, the result of the brain dominance thinking types, as well as the multiple intelligences are possible to be used as psy- chological dynamic factors of University Students.Second, the brain dominance thinking types weren't correlated to the academic achievement. The objects of current study were only D Univer- sity freshmen, so this caused problem to represent whole University Students. Also, we set the level of school achievement as average grade of first semester in their first year without concerning the major nor department, so there was a limitation of disclosing the level of school achievement among the D University Students.Third, the multiple intelligences was significantly positively correlated to the academic achievement. The specialized groups were significantly positively correlated to the unspecialized group but the each specialized group wasn't correlated to it.Therefore, the close correlations between the brain dominance thinking types and the multiple intelligences have revealed and they imply they can predict the level of school achievement of University Students depends on the brain dominance thinking types of the multiple intelli- gences. Also, a study, concerning the limitation of the current study through the post study is required for effectiveness verification of improvement strategy of University Students' school achievement depend on the brain dominance thinking types and the multiple intelligences. },

The result of the study revealed that students of Lakki Marwat estimated their logical/mathematical, intrapersonal, verbal/linguistic, and visual/spatial intelligence to be higher than those of the students in the other districts. Students of Bannu rated their musical intelligences higher than that of the students of other districts. Students of Hango estimated their bodily/kinesthetic intelligence higher than that of the students of other districts. Students of Kohat estimated their existential intelligence higher than that of the students of other districts. Researchers suggested that schools should give such an environment of learning to the students where all the intelligences can be focused and promoted. },

  abstract={ Acceleration of globalisation and the Fourth Industrial Revolution expanded opportunities for intercultural interaction, facilitated by more accessible and affordable information and communication technologies (ICT). Media literacy as framed by UNESCO is to be interpreted as [u]nderstanding and using mass media in either an assertive or non-assertive way, including an informed and critical understanding of media, the techniques they employ and their effects. Also the ability to read, analyse, evaluate and produce communication in a variety of media forms (alias the ability to decode, analyse, evaluate and produce communication in a variety of forms). Furthermore, media and information literacy refers to the essential competencies (knowledge, skills and attitude) that allow citizens to engage with media and other information. Dynamic developments in the contemporary world brought about by the post-factual era and the COVID-19 pandemic reinforced the exposure of the public to misinterpretation. Being conscious of variable and increasingly multidimensional presentation in academic literature of what it takes to be literate, in our paper we reflect on media literacy alias a synergy of literacy and multiple intelligences. Since on 12 April 2022 UNESCO launched a global survey Learning from the COVID-19 crisis to write the future: National policies and programmes for youth and adult literacy addressed to all 193 UNESCO Member States to fill in the gap and collect information on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on youth and adult literacy, our online questionnaire is complementary in terms of scope (media literacy) and outreach (higher education students). The aim of this paper is to investigate awareness, understanding and interpretation of literacy as such, and media literacy in particular, within the cohort of native and international students at the University of Economics in Bratislava, Slovakia. The findings revealed a higher ratio of the general understanding of communication and its role in the society, but a lower ratio of awareness about literacy and media literacy. In the context of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives our main suggestion, therefore, is to reinforce the media literacy curriculum in terms of experiential learning in line with the so-called learner-centred approach to education when the needs/aspirations of individuals are placed at the centre and focus is on the experiences they bring to the learning situation. },

Upon the analysis results, the reading education programs in the schools showed to be operated with interpersonal Intelligence. Community-aligned reading was the most frequently operated in the primary schools while student reading club activities were the most common in the middle and high schools. In case of reading education program related to linguistic intelligence, the most commonly operated ways were reading books, writing with literatures, and writing book report, in primary, middle, and high schools, respectively. In case of reading education program related to spatial intelligence, media production type showed the most commonly operated in all types of schools. However, there was no reading program related to naturalist intelligence. Based on these analysis results, the plans to contribute the activation of reading education programs by school libraries under the 2015 amended curriculum were suggested in the aspects of development of connection programs with teachers, students and parents as the center of education community, installation and operation of maker spaces and enhancement of program management and inquiry-based learning competency of teacher librarians. },

In this study, 2309 students from 43 Peruvian educational institutions participated, 1174 students from the sixth grade, and 1035 students from the fifth grade. The results indicated that, in the transition from primary to secondary school, interest in mathematics decreases. Also, intelligence highly represented in sixth grade was kinesthetic and in fifth grade, intrapersonal. On the other hand, sex and socio-economic status generate differences between students who more prefer and less prefer mathematics, as well as in multiple intelligences. Finally, logical-mathematical intelligence is the main differentiating factor between students who more prefer and less prefer mathematics. These findings are discussed using a set of psychosocial factors. },

The research was quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional and descriptive. The sample consisted of 293 participants (153 females and 140 males) out of a population of 424. The information was collected using an online Multiple Intelligences level questionnaire with an excellent level of reliability (alpha=0.913). The results achieved show that students possess all eight multiple intelligences to varying degrees. Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence reached the highest percentage (77%) while logical-mathematical intelligence the lowest (64%). In conclusion, it is necessary to deepen our knowledge of the multiple intelligences that can favor the integral development of university students. },

The aim of this article is to relate two theories regarding the structure of the human mind We suggest that the theory of multiple intelligences, a neurocognitive theory of the psychologist Howard Garnerd provides a suitable context for theoretical understanding and validation of the hypothesis of the pathology of superiority, a neuropsychological hypothesis formulated by the neuropsychologists Norman Geschwind and Albert Galaburda. Similarly, we show that, apart from being a context, the first theory enriches the second Development. We review the essential elements of both theories together with the arguments for them so that the reader may judge for himself Similarly we review the factors determining intelligence; the association between neuropathology and intellectual dysfunction, general and specific, and the new directions in the understanding of human cognition. Conclusions. We propose to consider the first theory as a fertile ambit and broad methodological framework for investigation in neuropsychology. This simultaneously shows the relevance of including neuropsychological investigation in broader cognitive and neuropsychological theories and models. },

To evaluate whether perceived multiple intelligences could be applied adequately across boys and girls, a model hypothesizing different degrees of equivalence across the two gender groups was tested using multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the structure of perceived multiple intelligences, which included the number and nature of dimensions, as well as the structural relationships among the 8 intelligences assessed, was largely similar for boys and girls. Subsequent second-order confirmatory factor analyses separately conducted for boys and girls suggested that both boys and girls might perceive the 8 intelligences or one of the nonpersonal intelligences. Implications of the findings including subtle differences in the perceived strengths on the 8 individual subtle differences in the perceived strengths on the 8 individual intelligences by boys and girls are discussed. },

According to the theory, intra- and interpersonal intelligence are considered to be part of a collection of intelligences that cover a wide spectrum of human behaviour. The issue is relevant firstly because the concept of intelligence is intensely discussed in order to view human competence from a personal, social, and instrumental point of view, and secondly because Gardner's theory has attracted wide attention in the world of pedagogy. The intention of the article is thus to examine if and how Gardner argues the existence of the 'personal intelligences'. },

  abstract={ In recent years, China has comprehensively carried out and implemented the national fitness campaign. Sports have been integrated into everyone's daily life. As a place for cultivating talents, colleges and universities have also begun to reform the physical education teaching mode and cultivate a number of talents with strong competition ability, teaching ability, and adaptability to the society. With the deepening of the reform of physical education teaching mode in colleges and universities, some colleges and universities have introduced the theory of multiple intelligences. By analyzing the concept and content of the theory of multiple intelligences and comparing it with the traditional physical education teaching mode, it fully reflects the advantages of the theory of multiple intelligences in physical education teaching. This paper uses fuzzy mathematics and fuzzy set algorithm to build a teaching model based on the theory of multiple intelligences. Moreover, we study the innovative methods of college physical education teaching, take college physical basketball teaching as the research object, and analyze the students' sports technology, students' teaching practice ability, and students' thinking ability based on the theory of multiple intelligences. Experimental outcomes show that the teaching method guided by the theory of multiple intelligences was designed for the intelligent characteristics of the students in the experimental group, and the teachers and students communicated with each other during the teaching period, which significantly improved the students' thinking ability. },

Personality and Individual Differences 30:857-871, 2001), a measure of Approaches to Learning Styles (Biggs 1987), a measure of the Big Five personality traits (Costa and McCrae 1992), as well as gave their own estimated scores on the Gardner (1999) multiple intelligences. Alpha co-efficients were modest with only three of the eight test-derived, multiple intelligence scores being over .70. 'Linguistic' and Mathematical intelligence alone were correlated with General Knowledge. Five of the eight 'intelligences' were correlated both with Extraversion and Openness. Regressions indicated that 'Intrapersonal intelligence' was closely linked with Stability and Conscientiousness; 'Interpersonal intelligence' with Extraversion; 'Linguistic intelligence' with Openness; 'Mathematical intelligence' with Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Correlations between self-estimated and test-derived emotional intelligence showed correlations ranging from r = .18 to r = .56 for similar type 'intelligences'. This study provides modest evidence for the concurrent and construct validity of this measure. It requires more psychometric evidence of validity before it is used. },

  abstract={ While contemporary trends in education emphasise the primacy of economic and technological competencies, imagination often finds itself under-valued. This is particularly true in Greece, where alternative schools encounter numerous challenges, some arising from discrimination. Imaginative teaching employs imagination-based teaching methods to support and enhance the development of children's and adolescents' physical, social, emotional and cognitive skills. This study explores the effects of imaginative teaching methods on students' abilities by examining 103 Greek students' self-perception of them. The abilities correspond to eight constructs, as described by Howard Gardner in his Multiple Intelligences (MI) theory. Prior research has hinted at the potential correlation between these imaginative teaching strategies and MI educational applications. The Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scale (MIDAS) was used to assess the 8 MI constructs and 24 associated skills. Statistically significant results show that students having imaginative-based education have a higher estimation of their language and intrapersonal skills. Further research is needed to move forward from assessing the self-perception of students' abilities to assessing their actual skills. },

Moreover, the study investigated their level of English learning motivation and multiple intelligences. Motivation was broken down into seven sub-categories, and multiple intelligence into eight for the analysis. For this study, three hypotheses were made in advance. The number of participants was 128 senior midshipmen, including 12 females. The participants' questionnaires on motivation and multiple intelligences were collected and surveyed. For the convenience of the analysis, the results of TEPS were divided into five categories: listening, reading, grammar, vocabulary, and total score. The research results showed that English learning motivation and multiple intelligences were positively correlated with each other. The correlation between the motivation and the results of the TEPS was also positive. However, the correlations between the sub-categories of motivation and those of multiple intelligences were differently realized. The research results may serve as a valuable asset for English teachers or people engaged in the language-learning field in Korea. },

  abstract={ Problem Statement: In deciding on a particular method to utilize for his/her students, a teacher needs to keep abrest of scientific and technological developments, follow a student-centered approach in teaching activities and consider individual differences among students. In this respect, focusing on Multiple Intelligences Theory (NUT) and cooperative learning considering Turkish Language Course could provide easiness in application and prove effective in developing the reading skill.The literature review conducted suggests that there have been studies supporting the view that cooperative learning method has positive effects on reading comprehension achievement and some studies assessing the academic achievement of MIT on various fields of study and its efficiency on the other auditory skills exist. However, no studies have been recorded regarding the assessment of MIT on the efficiency of the success in reading comprehension. In brief, a need for conducting the present study has emerged based on the reasons mentioned above.Purpose: The primary purpose of the study was to find out whether there are significant differences the in terms of reading comprehension achievement and the attitudes towards the Turkish language course between the experimental group in which the cooperative learning method supported by MIT applied in the forth grade Turkish language course in elementary education was administered and the control group in which the traditional method based on the teaching of whole class instruction was administered.Methods: The study was designed on the experimental group with pre-test and post-test control groups. The application was carried out on 117 fourth-grade students attending 3 classes in a state school for seven weeks. Reading Comprehension Achievement Test and Turkish Language Course Attitude Scale were administered as pre-test and post-test to both the groups. Teele Inventory for Multiple Intelligences (TIMI) was administered to find out the students' personal intelligence preferences related to the multiple intelligence areas. Covariance and Kruskal-Wallis analysis were utilized as the statistical technique in the evaluation of the data obtained.Findings and Results: The results obtained at the end of the study indicated that while there was a significant difference in favour of the experimental group in terms of the post-test scores on the achievement test, no significant different was observed between the control groups. Regarding the findings obtained from the Turkish Language Course Attitude Scale, no significant difference was observed in terms of positive attitude among the groups, whereas a significant difference was in favour of the experimental group and the second control group was detected.Recommendations: Taking the findings of the study into consideration, the cooperative learning method supported by MIT could be administered to improve the academic achievement of the students in regarding comprehension. However, long-term studies should be conducted to test its effect on the attitudes of the students towards the course. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to gain a greater understanding of the differences between multiple intelligences and their subsequent impact upon the creativity of high school students. In this study, high school students were divided based upon the general focus of their respective institutions. Groupings consisted of schools that provided general academic course work, those that provided specialized vocational training, and other more specialized schools. Specialized groupings allowed the relationships of components between multiple intelligences and creativity to be analyzed more deeply. Further, consideration was given to examine the differences between students with high creativity and those with low creativity. Four questions were composed for the purpose of this study. Firstly, do any differences exist in multiple intelligences amongst students attending different types of high schools? Secondly, are there any differences in creativity between them? Thirdly, what correlations exist between multiple intelligences and creativity? Lastly, are there any differences in multiple intelligences between the groups of high creativity and low creativity students? The results of these questions are as follows. First, in regards to musical intelligence, differences were revealed between general high schools and technical schools, and also between general high schools and other schools. In relation to logical-mathematical intelligence, there were significant differences between general high schools and technical schools, and between general high schools and other schools. In terms of interpersonal intelligence, there were differences only between general high schools and technical schools. Notable differences appeared with intrapersonal intelligence and naturalist intelligence only between technical schools and other schools. Second, differences appeared in openness only between general high schools and technical schools. Third, the spirit of independence, attachment, and openness had static correlation with every secondary component of multiple intelligences, and the willingness for adventure had static correlation with every secondary component of multiple intelligences, the exception being musical intelligence. Finally, when differences were revealed between high creativity and low creativity groups, it was in relation to independent spirit, adventurous spirit, and attachment, which are the secondary components of creativity. Between the high and low creativity groups, differences were also found amongst the secondary components of multiple intelligences. },

Although we regard components of intellectual structure as multiple, our theory of intelligence is also different from Gardner's. In this paper we (1) compare Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences and the theory of intelligence implied in the Six Arts education of ancient China, and (2) analyze Lin Chongde's theory of intelligence and his perspective that the components of intellectual structure are diverse. },

We worked with a sample of 1304 adolescents, with an average age of 16.81, divided into two groups of 652. Reliability was calculated with the Ordinal Alpha (Contreras & Novoa-Muñoz, 2018) and with the McDonald’s Omega coefficient, obtaining appropriate values. The Exploratory Factor Analysis (AFE) confirms the eight factors of the original version that explain 70% of the variability of the scores. With the confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA), adjustment indices were obtained confirming this factorial structure: SSc2 = 1857.73, gl = 1047, SSc2 / gl = 1.77, RMSEA = .035, SRMR = .049, CFI = .915, and TLI = .908. The results confirm that the IAMI-R is adequate to evaluate self-efficacy associated with multiple intelligences in Peruvian students who complete high school. },

Method: Participants were nursing students (N=186) who completed a questionnaire assessing criticalthinking disposition and multiple intelligences. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, analysis ofvariance with post hoc comparison, and Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: For type of multiple intelligences,32.9% of students had the strongest fit for “interpersonal intelligence” type and 20.1% for “intrapersonalintelligence” type. Mean score for critical thinking disposition was 3.42±0.37. Factors related to critical thinkingdisposition were participation in club activities (F=5.962, p=.001) with a representative role in the club (t=2.140,p=.034). There were significant differences in interpersonal intelligence scores by personality traits (t=2.445,p=.015), participation in club activities (F=10.003, p<.001), and friendship (t=2.539, p=.012); and significantdifferences in intrapersonal intelligence scores by participation in club activities (F=3.862, p=.010), having arepresentative role in the club (t=2.101, p=.037), and friendship (t=2.220, p=.029). Conclusion: Results indicate thatcritical thinking disposition is significantly associated with multiple intelligences and suggest that multipleintelligences should be considered to enhance critical thinking disposition when tailored teaching is adopted innursing education. },

But its credentials lack justification, as the first section of this paper shows via a detailed philosophical analysis of how the intelligences are identified. If we want to make sense of the theory, we need to turn from a philosophical to a historical perspective. This is provided in the second section, which explores how the theory came to take shape in the course of Gardner's intellectual development. The third section looks at changes in the theory since its inception in 1983 and at problems with its applications to education. The paper concludes with a response to Gardner's critical comments on the argument to this point. },

  abstract={ Photovoltaic output and load uncertainty are prone to cause voltage fluctuations in a distribution network, which can affect the power quality. With a particular focus on the distribution network voltage overrun caused by this problem, we propose a two-stage multi-mode voltage control strategy for distribution networks based on deep reinforcement learning to mitigate voltage fluctuations while realizing coordinated operation among different devices. First, the on-load regulator transformer and capacitor bank are effectively controlled using a centralized control strategy in the day-ahead phase to obtain the optimal tidal current for the distribution network, in order to achieve optimal operation of the long time-scale equipment of the system. Then, a distributed control strategy based on deep reinforcement learning with multiple intelligences is applied to regulate the reactive power of the photovoltaic inverters, based on local observations in the intraday phase, to provide fast, flexible, and reactive power support for the distribution network. Finally, a multi-mode data-driven conversion strategy based on deep reinforcement learning is used to coordinate and convert between different control modes, to enable the system to effectively reduce voltage offsets and reactive power losses under varying operational demand. The proposed method is experimentally validated on an improved IEEE 33-node distribution system, and the results show that it can effectively solve the voltage overrun problem and reduce the reactive power loss in the distribution system. },

The internal structure of three scales to assess students' MI (students, parents and teachers' ratings) was analyzed in a sample of 566 students nominated as gifted by their teachers. Participants aged 11 to 16 years (M = 14.85, SD = 1.08). The results indicated differentiated intellectual profiles depending on the informant estimating students' MI. This study provided evidence for two components that allow us to analyze the cognitive competence of high-ability students beyond the areas commonly assessed at school: an academic component composed by the linguistic, logical-mathematical, naturalistic, and visual-spatial intelligences; and a non-academic component statistically loaded by the bodily-kinesthetic, musical and social intelligences. Convergence of the two components in the three scales was evidenced; and correlations between these components and students' objective performance on a psychometric intelligence test were found to be low. Finally, the utility of the ME scales to identify high-ability students in secondary education is discussed. },

The present work has as its objective to analyze the changes occurred in the school atmosphere since the onset and implementation of the program at a Jewish school in Rio. The program's central idea is to work with the concepts of active learning and multiple intelligences as proposed by Piaget, Dewey, and Gardner. To analyze the PIE we used a qualitative approach with the participants of the study through semi-structured interviews and observations in classrooms of the 1st to 5th years of fundamental education. The analysis of the data was based on the theoretical framework. The results indicate that, after the implementation of the program, the professionals involved gained in motivation to search for information and refresh their knowledge in order to attend to the differences between the pupils, making use of diversified strategies and thus encouraging a more dynamic work that facilitates the development of students' autonomy. In terms of difficulties faced in the development of the program, there was mention to the need to revise timetables, and to the fact that teachers now have to go through more extensive curricula. The school is still in the process of adapting to this innovative program, and therefore it is very important that the professionals involved constantly reevaluate the development of the program, trying to identify modifications and alternatives as difficulties arise. },

One of the suggested procedures to estimate the variations is the Multiple Intelligence (MI) theory of Howard Gardner.Aim: The current research aims to study the relation among radiographic proximal caries detection accuracy and MI for dental undergraduate and new graduates (trainees)Patients and Methods: Twenty dental students who have just terminated caries detection training and 19 interns were employed. The sample composed of seventeen men and twenty two women. Caries detection precision was estimated as the region under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (Az) scores, and MI scores were estimated by sing a modified, bilingual MIS self-recorded questionnaire. MS Excel software was applied to calculate means, percentages and correlation.Results: There was little and mild positive correlation among Az and Spatial/Visual (0.29) and Intrapersonal (0.31) domains of MI respectively. The current correlation was mild for students (0.38) and (0.40), and it was lowered for interns (0.28) and (0.26) respectively.Conclusions: There is positive weak relationship between Az and the domains of Spatial/Visual and Intrapersonal of MI. This relationship might be diminished by education and training. },

  abstract={ The development of music teaching mode in colleges and universities needs to take music as the main body and carrier to spread and inherit the music theory system. With the continuous innovation and development of science and technology, the teaching mode and teaching system have also ushered in new changes. How to let students understand the process of music teaching and better appreciate the charm of music is the main problem faced by educators. Faced with the above situation, starting from the theory of multiple intelligences, this paper studies the innovation and discrete dynamic modeling of music teaching mode in colleges and universities. Firstly, this paper discusses the application effect of this method in music teaching based on the theory of multiple intelligences. This paper investigates the actual development of multiple intelligences theory in college music teaching. Combined with the characteristics of multiple intelligences theory, modeling and analysis of students' interest changes in the intelligent music education model represented by the space vector model are carried out. Finally, this paper studies the discrete dynamic modeling of students' learning effect after the optimization and innovation of music teaching mode in colleges and universities under the theory of multiple intelligences. The results show that in the innovation of music teaching mode, personalized learning services should be provided based on students' interests. The theory of multiple intelligences can help teachers to effectively analyze the diversity characteristics and changes of students in teaching activities, and it is of great help to improve students' musical performance. },

A cohort of sixty-six teacher students actively participated in this empirical investigation. Critical thinking proficiency was meticulously assessed employing a battery of tests and a comprehensive questionnaire. The findings of this study unequivocally demonstrate that multiple intelligences-based differential learning exerts a discernible influence on the development of critical thinking abilities among university students. Intriguingly, the study found no significant difference in critical thinking performance among the various types of intelligence. Additionally, this research posits that differential learning grounded in multiple intelligences represents a viable alternative pedagogical approach that should be earnestly embraced by educators when devising and implementing instructional strategies and methodologies. Such an approach, the study contends, holds the potential to augment students' cognitive capacities in a manner that aligns with the exigencies of 21st-century education.(c) 2023 The Authors.

There were consistent country and sex differences in self-estimates. Nambians tended to give lowest self-estimates and Zambians highest self-estimates. Contrary to previous findings from other continents females gave higher self-estimates than males on all seven multiple intelligences. These results were mirrored in the estimation of children: females gave higher scores than males and Zambians gave highest estimates and Nambians lowest. Reasons for these findings are discussed. },

The main aim of this research is to validate the instruments designed by Gardner in order to assess Multiple Intelligences (MI). This study uses the concept of cognitive abilities defined by Gardner, Feldman & Krechevsky (1998 a), which are considered as variables in order to make factorial analysis which determines the strength of the different abilities defined in the different intelligences- This study was done with a sample of 237 students (120 Boys and 117 girls). We used eleven activities to assess the Multiple Intelligences. The results of this study show that the factorial analysis adequately reproduces the multifactorial structure of intelligence, defined by Gardner (1998). The internal consistency of every one of the factors which the reliability analyses show reinforce the results of the factorial analysis, proving that the empirical data obtained reproduce the structure of Multiple Intelligences. },

Specifically, we analyze three types of activities including project, game, and cultural activities in three types of the 5th grade English textbooks. Additionally, we compare the differences in the Multiple Intelligences according to three different publishers. The data includes three different sorts of fifth-grade English textbook activities. We found that verbal-linguistic intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, and visual-spatial intelligence are heavily involved in project activities. Verbal-linguistic intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, visual-spatial intelligence, and kinesthetic intelligence are all utilized in game activities. Lastly, cultural activities demonstrate verbal-linguistic and visual-spatial intelligence. In consideration of the diversity of students, we suggest that English textbooks need to consider diverse and well balanced approach to incorporating Multiple Intelligences in order to make the textbooks to meet the needs of the diversity of learners. },

Subordinate ratings of three dimensions of transformational leadership were used as the criteria. Correlation analysis and a series of multiple hierarchical regressions were used to determine the relationship between the multiple intelligences and three dimensions of transformational leadership.Findings-Results indicate that a multiple intelligences framework is a useful approach to predict transformational leadership. Correlation analyses and multiple regression results indicated that the multiple intelligence framework explained between 10 and 25 percent of the variance in perceptions of transformational leadership and that assessment center dimensions explained additional variance beyond paper-and-pencil measures in transformational leadership.Originality/value-This paper extends previous research by examining the impact of cognitive, emotional, and social intelligences on transformational leadership using multiple measurement methodologies. The results of this study provide a useful framework for practitioners interested in assessing precursors to transformational leadership, with a focus on assessment centers as a useful tool for predicting transformational leadership. },

  abstract={ The Theory of multiple intelligences suggests that it is necessary to develop new methods to assess and conceptualise the human intellect. It is envisaged that serious games can offer an alternative form of evaluation, as game designers can create gameplay environments that incorporate the different intelligences into clues, puzzles and game challenges, so that players can not only acquire knowledge, social support and self-efficacy, but also easily evaluate their skills and abilities. This study aims to analyse the classificatory precision of cognitive profiles acquired from the use of a serious game based on multiple intelligences as well as examine the agreement between the serious game results and a self-report questionnaire. The sample consisted of 209 participants (22.5% men), aged between 19 and 59 years (M = 22.83, SD = 6.36) from secondary to higher education. The results revealed that the serious game presented a different classification capacity compared to the self-report questionnaire. The possibility of identifying different cognitive profiles would have implications for educators and researchers. For educators, it would allow the incorporation of more individualised and inclusive education practices, by adapting teaching methods to each student's learning style. For researchers, it would shed light on the various structures of multiple intelligences in different samples. },

Proponents countered that their theories had sufficient empirical support, were consistent with cognitive neuroscience findings, and should be applied in education (Cherniss, Extein, Goleman, & Weissberg, 2006; Gardner & Moran, 2006; Rauscher & Hinton, 2006). However, Gardner and Moran offered no validating evidence for multiple intelligences, Rauscher and Hinton concluded that listening-to-Mozart studies should be disregarded, and Cherniss, Extein, Goleman, and Weissberg agreed that emotional intelligence lacked a unitary empirically supported construct. My reply addresses theory proponents' specific criticisms of my review and reasserts my original claims. },

Gardner insists that bodily intelligence is an independent ability like linguistic or logical-mathematic intelligence. This idea is supported by many theories such as neurophysiology, anthropology and developmental psychology.Bodily intelligence can be used and developed in activities of dancers and athletes, but they are completely different areas, like novelist and lawyer who are entirely different each other in the linguistic intelligence.Dancers use action for their symbolic representation and athletes use it for their functional reason. In this point dance as a symbolic activity is separated from physical education of which main activity is sports or game.Until recently dance education has been considered as emotional activity. But when we follow the idea of Gardner it should be directed to symbolic activity. },

The results indicated that the learning achievement of the students taught using interactive whiteboards was greater than that of the students taught using lectures. Among the students in the experimental group using interactive whiteboards, the learning achievement of the students with weaker logical-mathematical intelligence was higher than that of those with strong logical-mathematical intelligence.

Moreover, this work also investigates under what conditions multiple intelligences can magnify their effects. By adopting a qualitative study approach including, in-depth interviews of experts, employers and expatriates, this study reveals that the use of multiple intelligences is contingent upon expatriates' commitment toward the organization, social support, functional interaction, and assignment tenure. },

Over 600 students from New Zealand completed a brief questionnaire based on those used in previous research (Furnham, 2001). Three of the ten self-estimates yielded significant sex differences. Males believed they were more intelligent than females on mathematical (logical), spatial and existential intelligence. Those who had previously completed an IQ test gave higher self-estimates on eight of the ten estimates. Self-estimates were compared to university samples from America and Britain, and results tended to show New Zealand students gave lower self-estimates particularly on mathematical, body-kinetic, existential, spiritual and naturalistic intelligence. Factor analysis showed the ten multiple intelligences fell into three interpretable factors which were predicted by both gender and test experience. },

Observation of group work in Afrikaans Methodology classes at the University of Pretoria revealed that these learners fended to experience co-operative learning and group work negatively. The observations were followed up by interviews with the participants. The researchers found that the participants withdrew front collaborative learning environments and they indicated both verbally and non-verbally that group work irritated them. They preferred to complete their assignments alone and disliked the interdependence a collaborative learning situation forced anthem. We conclude with the recommendation that group work should be used with care and. an understanding of differences in learning styles by teachers and lecturers. },

A general population sample of 261 British participants completed one of four questionnaires that required them to estimate their own and others' multiple intelligences and personality traits. Males estimated their general IQ slightly, but mathematic IQ significantly higher than females, who rated their social and emotional intelligence higher than males. Masculine individuals awarded themselves somewhat higher verbal and practical IQ scores than did female participants. Both participant gender and gender role differences in IQ estimates were found, with gender effects stronger in cognitive and gender role than in personal ability estimates. There was a significant effect of gender role on hypothetical persons' intelligence evaluations, with masculine targets receiving significantly higher intelligence estimates compared to feminine targets. More intelligent hypothetical figures were judged as more masculine and less feminine than less intelligent ones. },

The research examined associations between identified profiles of trait emotional intelligence and multiple intelligences, and academic success in the sample of 288 IT students, 208 from Serbia and 80 from Greece. The results show that trait emotional intelligence and multiple intelligences profile both proved to be important predictors of academic success. Another predictor of IT students' academic success was related to their prior schooling success. The results indicate that fostering a student-centered learning model through tertiary education, with special emphasis on students' personal dispositions and traits, could be crucial for their academic success, especially in the multidisciplinary field of information technology. },

  abstract={ Increasing attention paid to learner-centered pedagogy in recent years has highlighted the examination of intelligence and language learning strategies (LLSs) among others. This study explores EFL learners` perceived use of language learning strategies across various intelligence types as reflected in Gardner`s 1983 Multiple Intelligences Theory. Ninety BA Junior English majors studying at Islamic Azad University of Rasht participated in the present study. Two self-reported inventories, Multiple Intelligences Survey (Armstrong, 1993) and Strategy Inventory for Language Learning (SILL) (ESL/EFL Version) developed by Oxford (1990), were utilized to determine the participants` intelligence profile and their perceived strategy use. The findings of the study revealed that intelligence did not significantly affect the overall strategy use of the participants. All types of intelligence fell within the ``medium`` user of LLSs. However, participants of verbal linguistic type were found to be higher in terms of their strategy use and visual-spatial students were the lowest strategy users overall. In addition, participants of verbal-linguistic type were found to be higher users of cognitive strategies. In terms of metacognitive strategies, verballinguistic, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalist were found to be higher than logical-mathematical, visual-spatial and musical-rhythmic types. Visual-spatial learners were also found to be lower in terms of their use of social strategies. The conclusions of the study along with related pedagogical implications are explained. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study was to present a schematic plan for the improvement of students' technological problem-solving skills to the educational work places through the looking into the constituents of multiple intelligences affecting technological problem-solving skills. The specific purposes of the study were to find out the constituents of multiple intelligences affecting 1) 'content understanding' in the technological problem-solving skills, 2) 'domain dependent problem-solving strategy' in the technological problem-solving skills, 3) 'self-regulation' in the technological problem-solving skills. The subjects were 834 3rd year grade junior highschool students who belonged to the 4 junior highschools located in Daejeon city in Korea. The tool for investigating the independent variables was Korean version of Gardener's multiple intelligence test developed by Moon, et al. Another tool for the dependent variable was the problem-solving(technological problem-solving) test developed by CRESST(National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing) in 1998. The results of this study were as follows. First. Logical-mathematical intelligence(LMI), naturalist intelligence(NI), and spatial intelligence(SI) were brought out as the constituents of multiple intelligences affecting 'content understanding' in the technological problem-solving skills. These three constituents turned out to be explaining 4.7%(3.7% for LMI + 0.4% for NI +0.6% for SI) of the 'content understanding' in the technological problem-solving skills. Second. Linguistic intelligence(LI), musical intelligence(MI), body-kinesthetic intelligence(BKI), and logical-mathematical intelligence were brought out as the constituents of multiple intelligences affecting 'domain dependent problem-solving strategy' in the technological problem-solving skills. The total explaining proportion of these four constituents for the 'domain dependent problem-solving strategy' in the technological problem-solving skills was 7.4%(4.5% for LI + 1.2% for MI + 1.0% for BKI + 0.7% for LMI). Third. The constituents of multiple intelligence affecting 'self-regulation' in the technological problem-solving skills were logical-mathematical intelligence(LMI), intrapersonal intelligence(IraI), and linguistic intelligence(LI). These three constituents explained 40.6%(31.1% for LMI + 7.5% for IraI + 2.0% for LI) of the 'self-regulation' in the technological problem-solving skills. },

Using elementary students and subject matters, two study group were organized and received a experimental learning material. Experimental group was organized for matching and stretching MI, and took group learning activities on the base of JIGSAW Ⅱ. But comparative group was organized for only matching MI, and learned their tasks on the basis of each students' strong intelligence.The results of this study was as follows; First, According to the result of pretest-posttest analysis of Shearer's Multiple Intelligences Development Assessment Scale(MIDAS), there was significant difference in the level of MI between experimental and comparative groups.Second, like a difference in MI, there was significant difference in the score of Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCT) between experimental and comparative groups.Third, the effects of MI as a teaching method could be more greater when organizing a cooperative learning group on the basis of matching and stretching MI than a simple strong intelligence group considering only the matching MI.Finally, the applying the method of matching and stretching MI simultaneously could be a efficient approach to the development of individual latent competencies and a construction of individualized instruction. },

For comparison, IQ, creativity, and leadership characteristics of these students were also assessed using conventional standardized measures. Data on academic achievement in Chinese language, English language, and mathematics were obtained from school records. While students perceived the seven intelligences as relatively distinct abilities, these self-estimates of the seven intelligences did not generally predict the conventional measures, suggesting that the seven intelligences and the conventional measures provided independent and possibly complementary information on aspects of giftedness. The implications of the development of a profile of strengths and weaknesses of students from a multiple intelligences perspective for subsequent identification and programming are discussed. },

The procedures of the study were as follows: First, the author contemplated MI Theory and the possibilities of applying it to middle school art appreciation courses. In addition, the author searched for relationships between cognitive realms of MI Theory and learning motivation and performance. Based upon this theoretical background, the author set art appreciation as the main topic of units in a middle school’s art course and designed teaching-learning programs regarding MI Theory’s modalities after analyzing the revised middle school art curricula. 16 female students of S middle school in Y Province were selected as an experimental group, and total of 10 periods of art appreciation classes that applied MI Theory were conducted on the group. To verify the effectiveness of the program, the experimental group’s multiple intelligences were assessed through MI Pretest developed by Yong Lin Moon(2001). The reliability of the pretest has been verified and widely acknowledged. In addition, the author developed measurement tools for measuring learning motivation and academic achievement, whose validity was proven by an education expert and a school art teacher. These tools were used to measure learning motivation and academic achievement of the group before and after the art appreciation classes. The measured results were processed through SPSS Ver 21.0. The conclusion of the study is as follows: teaching-learning plans that applied H.Gardner’s MI Theory were proven to be effective in enhancing 7th graders’ learning motivation. },

  abstract={ The use of Gardner's multiple intelligences (MI) theory is touted as one of the ideal ways of teaching students with diverse intelligences. However, there appears to be paucity of research in this area of knowledge. This study, therefore, explored the application of multiple intelligences approach in the teaching of Economics. The study was a quantitative research that adopted the descriptive cross-sectional survey design. In total, 100 senior high school teachers were selected for the study. Data were collected by the use of a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, ranging from never to very frequently. Descriptive (mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (MANOVA) were used to analyse the data. The study revealed that Economics teachers frequently used interpersonal intelligences in teaching Economics. Additionally, it was found out that there was a statistically significant difference in the application of bodily-kinesthetic intelligence approach in the teaching of Economics based on Economics teachers' teaching experience. However, the findings of the study showed no statistically significant difference in the Economics teachers' application of MI approach in the teaching of Economics based on their gender. It was, thus, recommended that Ghana Education Service, Ministry of Education, and Non-Governmental Organisations should organise seminars and conferences for teachers to deepen their understanding of the application of the MI approach in the teaching of Economics. In addition, heads of senior high schools should organise professional development programmes and conferences to enable teachers acquire information on the following domains of MI: logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, and naturalistic intelligences. },

  abstract={ It is shown that the critical remarks posed by Kim and Hoppe-Graff do not seriously invalidate Rost's critical objections to Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligences (MI). Among others, the following main points of critique are again emphasized: The apparent lack of sound quantitative-empirical research supporting the MI-theory, the deficient attempts to assess MI, and the lack of sound quantitative-empirical evaluations of the attempts to implement the MI-theory into educational practice. Methodological pluralism makes sense; but deficient methodological approaches, i.e., subjective and hence problematic approaches which are frequently found in studies of MI-followers, should never serve as a substitute for sound empirical research. },

As career development education for higher grades of elementary school aims at providing basic knowledge necessary for career choice and forming a basic attitude toward occupation and values, it is desirable to carry out the guidance of a variety of occupations on the basis of personal interest and aptitude of individual students. Previously, however, most studies have remained at the level where simply test results are notified.Therefore, the study administered a career development test fit for higher grades of elementary school who are at the stage of potential career choice and developed a web-based career guidance system in which suitable occupation types are advised of based on the results. Beyond notifying test results, the developed career guidance system presents 3 excellent intelligences, rather than converting test results into scores. Thus, it is expected that the system will help students understand their areas of excellent intelligence, efficiently study related occupation types and duties, and learn to have awareness and make a better decision in relation to their career. },

  abstract={ This study aimed to investigate the spread of activation and part-set effect in attrited semantic sets, the relationship between multiple intelligences and second language attrition, and the differences between high and low attriters' intelligence levels in 54 lower-intermediate and beginner participants after 1 to 35 years of disuse. After identifying attrited words through a 133-word checklist of 12 semantic sets, translation and match-making tasks were devised to investigate the spread of activation. The results showed that the spread of activation is not significantly different between the recognition and production levels or across proficiency levels, and that it Is unrelated to the length of disuse. Furthermore, this study shows that the part-set effect exists in semantic sets, so it could be hypothesized that the quick relearning of languages might be due to the spread of activation. Additionally, a significant relationship was found between musical intelligence and the amount of attrition in low attriters, as well as a significant difference between high and low attriters in terms of intrapersonal intelligence. Thus, these might be a few of the variables that are key in reducing the :amount of attrition in this study. },

In contrast to previous results (A. Furnham, 2001) sex differences in self-estimates did not occur In this Guinean sample. Participants rated overall intelligence of their father higher than that of their mother. An existing data set on estimates of intelligence in a Portuguese sample was used for a cross-cultural comparison between Portuguese and Guinean participants. There were consistent and clear culture differences. Guinean gave higher self, partner and family ratings than Portuguese. Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the self-estimates of intelligence, as well as limitations of that approach. },

It was one of a programmatic series of studies done in over 30 countries that has demonstrated the female humility'' and male hubris'' effect in self-estimated and other-estimated intelligence. Two hundred and thirty Russian university students estimated their own and their parents' overall intelligence and multiple intelligences.'' Results revealed no sex difference in estimates of overall intelligence for both self and parents, but men rated themselves higher on spatial intelligence. This contradicted many previous findings in the area which have shown that men rate their own overall intelligence and mathematical intelligence significantly higher than do women. Regressions indicated that estimates of verbal, logical, and spatial intelligences were the best predictors of estimates of overall intelligence, which is a consistent finding over many studies. Regressions also showed that participants' openness to experience and self-respect were good predictors of intelligence estimates. A comparison with a British sample showed that Russians gave higher mother estimates, and were less likely to believe that IQ tests measure intelligence. Results were discussed in relation to the influence of gender role stereotypes on lay conception of intelligence across cultures. },

  abstract={ This article proposes that consideration could be given to an invitational intervention rather than an expectational intervention when support personnel respond to a critical incident in schools. Intuitively many practitioners know that it is necessary for guidance/counselling personnel to intervene in schools in and following times of trauma. Most educational authorities in Australia have mandated the formulation of a critical incident intervention plan. This article defines the term critical incident and then outlines current intervention processes, discussing the efficacy of debriefing interventions. Recent literature suggests that even though it is accepted that a planned intervention is necessary, there is scant evidence as to the effectiveness of debriefing interventions in stemming later symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. The authors of this article advocate for an expressive therapy intervention that is invitational rather than expectational, arguing that not all people respond to trauma in the same way and to expect that they will need to recall and retell what has happened is most likely a dangerous assumption. A model of invitation using Howard Gardner's (1983) multiple intelligences is proposed so that students are invited to grieve and understand emotionally what is happening to them following a critical incident. },

This action research study takes a qualitative approach to collect information from semi-structured interviews with open questions, applied to eleven elementary school teachers and three parents of students with intellectual disabilities, which was triangulated with a referential and legal component for its analysis and results. This study was based on the sociocultural theory of Lev S. Vygotsky and the theory of multiple intelligences by Howard Gardner. The research concludes with the design of a two-part pedagogical proposal, the first part referring to legislation on inclusive education and, the second, concrete pedagogical actions in the classroom to improve the teachers' teaching processes and the students' learning processes, within the framework of Education for All, based on the incorporation of Cooperative Learning by Johnson & Johnson, in the development of thematic content in different areas. },

A descriptive, cross-sectional, and non-experimental research with the purpose of this study is to establish the relationships between practice of physical activity and the intelligences and determine the relationship between diet and the different types of intelligence in 215 university students. Findings indicate higher adherence to Mediterranean Diet in women and higher physical activity scores in men. Regarding multiple intelligences, men have higher indices in Bodily-kinesthetic, Interpersonal, Logical-mathematical, Musical, and Spatial intelligences, while women show higher levels in relation to Linguistic, Intrapersonal, and Naturalistic intelligences. Main conclusions from this study suggest the relationship between multiple intelligence and healthy habits, while also highlighting the need to improve eating habits and achieve greater adherence to Mediterranean Diet. },

Based on the theory of multiple intelligences, this paper constructs a model for evaluating the quality of vocal music teaching for music majors and introduces the theory of multiple intelligences into the operation form, design requirements, and recommended lesson examples of music teaching unit design. The experimental data and questionnaire data collected by the model verify that this operation is beneficial to the improvement of students' music listening scores, vocal music comprehension scores, and total scores and solves the quantitative problem of vocal music teaching quality evaluation. In the simulation process, the engineering testing and analysis method uses the correlation rate and correlation strength as the analysis indicators, comparing the platforms for the quality evaluation of vocal music teaching in music majors and the corresponding quality evaluation data preprocessing process. The experimental results show that the algorithm performance evaluation is carried out based on the three aspects of quality evaluation association rules, algorithm running time, and algorithm memory consumption. The multiple intelligence algorithm is applied to vocal music teaching analysis of association rules for quality evaluation: when 4000 tasks call for 20-40 virtual resources, the total time spent is reduced by 61.7%, which has a significant positive effect on the knowledge expansion and ability improvement of music majors. },

  abstract={ Character education is an education within the course of life, where people experience and learn various things throughout their life, not corresponding to the courses and results of conveying knowledge. EthicalÂ·moral knowledge can be passed on through the moral education course that students come to take in elementaryÂ·junior highÂ·high school. However, the way to practice and course of performance, through which the knowledge is put into practice, is character education itself that should be given throughout the whole lifespan.In consideration of this reflective standpoint, it was intended to check the present condition and actual state of current pre-service teachers' character education, and was intended to seek a teaching and learning plan for cultivating the pre-service teachers' character at a pioneering level in Howard Gardner's multiple intelligence. In particular, it is intended to make an approach by intrapersonal intelligence through which people can reflect on themselves, develop personality and disposition, and discipline themselves and interpersonal intelligence of performance through which people can build a good relationship with others, perceive other people's emotion, express knowledge acquired in ethicalÂ·moral cognitive development with speech and behavior appropriate for situation among 8 types of multiple intelligences. },

In contrast to previous results (A. Furnham, 2001), there were few gender differences in self-estimates. In a comparison of Black and White South Africans, it was clear the Whites gave higher estimates for self, parents, and brothers. However, overall IQ estimates for self and all relatives hovered around the mean of 100. When Black South Africans and Nigerians were compared, there were both gender and nationality differences on the self-estimates with men giving higher self-estimates than women and Nigerians higher self-estimates than South Africans. There were also gender and nationality differences in the answers to questions about IQ. The authors discuss possible reasons for the relatively few gender differences in this study compared with other studies as well as possible reasons for the cross-cultural difference. },

  abstract={ This study examined the self-perceived intelligences (multiple intelligences, emotional intelligence, and successful intelligence) of 498 Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong. Based on the associations among perceived intelligence scores, three dimensions could be distinguished to describe giftedness and could be interpreted as global giftedness, socioemotional giftedness, and artistic giftedness. Using profiles of perceived intelligences, students could be classified as falling into four clusters of supersmart students, socioemotionally gifted students, modest gifted students, and artistically gifted students. The supersmart students engaged in more activities related to leadership and creativity than the other clusters of students, with the modest gifted students reporting the least engagement. The supersmart students, however, were rated by teachers as less emotionally mature, showing less concern for others, and more likely to have behavioral conduct problems than the socioemotionally gifted students. Implications of the findings for conceptualizing giftedness and working with different groups of gifted students are discussed. },

  abstract={ Modern global managers are required to possess a set of competencies or multiple intelligences in order to meet pressing business challenges. Hence, expanding global managers' competencies is becoming an important issue. Many scholars and specialists have proposed various competency models containing a list of required competencies. But it is hard for someone to master a broad set of competencies at the same time. Here arises an imperative issue on how to enrich global managers' competencies by way of segmenting a set of competencies into some portions in order to facilitate competency development with a stepwise mode. To solve this issue involving the vagueness of human judgments, we have proposed an effective method combining fuzzy logic and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to segment required competencies for better promoting the competency development of global managers. Additionally, an empirical study is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed method. (C) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd. },

The results of this study form part of a broader ongoing research project, in collaboration with the University of Seville, aimed at investigating the influence of the Early Childhood Music Education project on general aspects of child development. This study has a quasi-experimental design, framed in Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences, consisting of an experimental and a control group (n = 1101) and the administration of a questionnaire, adapted to measure and compare means between the two groups, as the sole measurement tool. The results, analysed using an independent samples t-test for the comparison of means and Cohen's d effect size, reveal statistically significant differences in the means of the dimensions of the experimental and control groups. This confirms the hypothesis that the Early Childhood Music Education project has a positive impact on the different dimensions, in accordance with Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences. },

  abstract={ Optional university courses are designed to allow undergraduate students to specialize in relevant fields to enhance their skills and knowledge for their future careers. However, there are some cases in which students prioritize enrolling in courses that are easy to pass. This choice results in having students with low motivation and commitment, who mainly focus on doing just enough to pass the course, missing the opportunity to boost their skills. In this study, an eclectic approach is proposed, applying a mixture of active learning methods together with the theory of multiple intelligences to improve students' performance, motivation, and commitment throughout the course. The study was applied to the 56 students enrolled in the optional Micro-Robotics Application spring course in the year 2021 at the University of Cadiz (Spain). Results demonstrate that this combination of active learning methodologies increased students' motivation, prompting them to give their best in terms of commitment, performance, and creativity. Furthermore, they were convinced that during the course they not only learned relevant robotic knowledge but also acquired essential skills needed for their future. Finally, this study highlights the benefits and future directions for implementing active learning methodologies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses. },

This study is thereby built on the premise that EFL readers' metacognitive awareness of reading strategies was also influenced by their multiple intelligence profiles. The purpose of this study is to explore the integrated impact of multiple intelligences and reading strategies on EFL learners' reading performance. This was an explanatory sequential study, combining quantitative and qualitative research design. A convenience sample of 60 high school EFL learners from one of the Anatolian high schools in Istanbul, Turkey participated in this study. Two quantitative surveys and an achievement test, followed by a qualitative observation checklist, were used in this study to collect the data. The results of the study indicated that females were found to be more successful than males in EFL reading in addition to employing more support and problem solving reading strategies. In addition, this study also found that successful readers in EFL seemed to use more global strategies and tended to support reading strategies if they were dominant in musical, intrapersonal intelligences. Moreover, successful musically or verbally intelligent readers were found to use more problem-solving strategies. As a result, this study provides EFL teachers and curriculum designers with valuable information that will foster awareness of the role of these intelligence-strategy relations may play in triggering success in EFL reading, and thus, in their overall proficiency in the language. },

The results indicate that trainee teachers' beliefs in education myths and misconceptions may not change over the course of a five-year 'evidence based' teacher preparation program. Further, the qualitative results suggest that beliefs in learning myths might become further entrenched over the course of study as a result of being actively promoted by faculty throughout the program. },

They made these estimations (11 in all) for themselves, their partner, and for various well-known figures such as Prince Charles, Tony Blair, Bill Gates, and Bill Clinton. Following previous research there were various sex and nationality differences in self-estimated IQ: Males rated themselves higher on verbal, logical, spatial, and spiritual IQ compared to females. Females rated their male partner as having lower verbal and spiritual, but higher spatial IQ than was the case when males rated their female partners. Participants considered Bill Clinton (2 points) and Prince Charles (5 points) less intelligent than themselves, but Tony Blair (5 points) and Bill Gates (15 points) more intelligent than themselves. Multiple regressions indicated that the best predictors of one's overall IQ estimates were logical, verbal, existential, and spatial IQ. Factor analysis of the 10 and then 8 self-estimated scores did not confirm Gardner's classification of multiple intelligences. Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the self-estimates of intelligence, a. well as limitations of that approach. },

In this sense, there are transversal factors that unify the institution, creativity and intelligence. Teachers have an unprecedented variety of instruments at their disposal to enhance them, and they are increasingly valued, so they are specifically encouraged in the various curricula. One promising proposal to promote these competencies is augmented reality. The article tries to explain how this narrative is beginning to be a resource that enhances divergent thinking in the university space. The innovation that justifies the research is offered from the convergence with Gardner's studies, since applying the taxonomy of multiple intelligences is in communion with critical thinking and the personalized development of students' abilities. The methodology is based on a process of theorization and a Likert questionnaire to which university students with knowledge in extended realities have been submitted, presenting several immersive apps observed from the multi intelligences as case studies. As a conclusion, augmented reality at the University is perceived among students as a story that drives creativity and personalized multi-intelligences. },

  abstract={ This study focuses on lay conceptions of intelligence. It examined sex and cross-cultural similarities and differences in estimated intelligences and beliefs about intelligence in two countries, Angola and East Timor, within the reversal theory framework. A total of 209 Angolan (109 women and 100 men) and 183 Timorese (89 women and 94 men) students were participated in this study. Participants completed a questionnaire in order to estimate their parents', partners' and own overall intelligence and the 8 reversal multiple intelligences (telic, paratelic, conformist, negativistic, autic mastery, autic sympathy, alloic mastery and alloic sympathy intelligence). Respondents also rated 6 questions about intelligence. Men rated their overall, conformist and autic mastery higher than women. Angolans rated their overall, telic, paratelic, conformist, negativistic, autic mastery, autic sympathy, alloic mastery and alloic sympathy intelligence higher than Timorese. In both countries, fathers have been perceived as more intelligent than mothers, and telic intelligence emerged as a significant predictor of overall intelligence. Principal component analysis of the 8 reversal multiple intelligences yielded one factor. Angolan participants revealed more IQ test experience than Timorese participants. Most of respondents in both countries did not believe in sex differences in intelligence. These findings are discussed by means of cross-cultural literature. },

This pilot study looks at the relationship between learning style, as measured with the Multiple Intelligences Developmental Assessment Scales (MIDAS), laparoscopic surgery experience and psychomotor skill performance using the MIST VR surgical simulator.METHODS: Five groups of volunteer subjects were selected from undergraduate tertiary students, medical students, novice surgical trainees, advanced surgical trainees and experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Each group was administered the MIDAS followed by two simulated surgical tasks on the MIST VR simulator.RESULTS: There was a striking homogeny of learning styles amongst experienced laparoscopic surgeons. Significant differences in the distribution of primary learning styles were found (P < .01) between subjects with minimal surgical training and those with considerable experience. A bodily-kinesthetic learning style, irrespective of experience, was associated with the best performance of the laparoscopic tasks.CONCLUSION: This is the first study to highlight the relationship between learning style, psychomotor skill and laparoscopic surgical experience with implications for surgeon selection, training and credentialling.

  abstract={ The level and style of teaching management have been continuously updated and enhanced as part of China's educational system reform in recent years. A new era of individualized learning and teaching administration has begun as a result of the fusion of cutting-edge educational technologies and pedagogical theories. In light of this, we introduced a teaching management system created for the ever-changing needs of physical education in colleges and universities. We use support vector machines (SVM) to personalize and improve students' educational experiences by using the Theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as our theoretical framework. In the very first step, we started with the collection of diverse student information, such as academic records, athletic prowess, and many intelligence profiles. To obtain this information, multiple skills of all the students were thoroughly analyzed using MI's theory. By conducting thorough feature engineering and data preprocessing, we established the foundation for our analysis using SVM. In this phase, we score each student's performance in sports-related skills. From there, we created a profile for each student and preprocessed the data to build a useful dataset. This dataset trains an SVM model to forecast student engagement and performance using specific kernels and hyperparameters. Our proposed system places a big emphasis on personalized learning. We enable teachers to design a learning environment that fosters student potential by adapting teaching tactics to individual student's strengths and limitations in both sports skills and multiple intelligences. The effectiveness of the system is assessed by separating the students into two groups: one group received training using our suggested system, known as the experimental group, and the other group, known as the control group, received training using the conventional approach. The result shows that the score of the experimental group is 88.9, which is higher than the control group's 83.5. The result shows that after applying MI's theory and SVM in physical education teaching in colleges and universities, the scores have been significantly improved, which can maximize the students' multiple intelligences. },

  abstract={ With the advent of fourth industrial revolution, more sophisticated information society will need new and refined definition for individual talent. This leads to more emphasis on revamping conventional education than ever. Multiple intelligence theory has drawn attention from quite a few scholars in education and psychology fields recently. College students majoring in design and arts are educated mainly with art-based theory and practices, but they go into variety of industries not to mention design, advertising, arts shop and so on. Therefore they will need intelligences that are wider than arts and design area. This paper attempts to find out how the multiple intelligence of design and art students distributes and to delve into how it relates to their major satisfaction and perceived work accomplishment. Design and arts students in their second year through fifth year in a major college are surveyed for the research. As results, their visual-spatial, intrapersonal, interpersonal intelligences are significantly higher than other five intelligences. Intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences are positively related to their major satisfaction. Intrapersonal and verbal-linguistic intelligences are found to affect perceived accomplishment level which is positively related to bodily-kinesthetic, logical-mathematical, verbal-linguistic and two more intelligences. Results of the study would shed some lights into development of proper courses that help design and art students cultivate intelligences for the challenging era of fourth industrial revolution. },

  abstract={ Learning characteristics, as informed by research, vary for each individual learner. Research suggests that knowledge is processed and represented in different ways and that students prefer to use different types of resources in distinct ways. However, building Adaptive Educational systems that adapt to different learning characteristics is not easy. Major research questions exist such as: how are the relevant learning characteristics identified, how does modelling of the learner take place and in what way should the learning environment change for users with different learning characteristics?EDUCE is one system that addresses these challenges by using Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences (MI) as the basis for dynamically modelling learning characteristics and for designing instructional material. This paper describes a research study, using EDUCE, that explores the effect of using different adaptive presentation strategies and the impact on learning performance when material is matched and mismatched with learning preferences. The results suggest that students with low levels of learning activity, and, who use only a limited number of the resources available, have the most to benefit from adaptive presentation strategies and that surprisingly learning gain increases when they are provided with resources not normally preferred.

This study is thereby built on the premise that EFL readers' metacognitive awareness of reading strategies was also influenced by their multiple intelligence profiles. The purpose of this study is to explore the integrated impact of multiple intelligences and reading strategies on EFL learners' reading performance. This was an explanatory sequential study, combining quantitative and qualitative research design. A convenience sample of 60 high school EFL learners from one of the Anatolian high schools in Istanbul, Turkey participated in this study. Two quantitative surveys and an achievement test, followed by a qualitative observation checklist, were used in this study to collect the data. The results of the study indicated that females were found to be more successful than males in EFL reading in addition to employing more support and problem solving reading strategies. In addition, this study also found that successful readers in EFL seemed to use more global strategies and tended to support reading strategies if they were dominant in musical, intrapersonal intelligences. Moreover, successful musically or verbally intelligent readers were found to use more problem-solving strategies. As a result, this study provides EFL teachers and curriculum designers with valuable information that will foster awareness of the role of these intelligence-strategy relations may play in triggering success in EFL reading, and thus, in their overall proficiency in the language. },

  abstract={ Some educational psychologists and researchers have argued that there are multiple ways of being intelligent. In the early 1980s, Howard Gardner presented a theory of multiple intelligences by proposing that humans can be described not by a single kind of intelligence, or intelligence quotient score, but rather by a variety of kinds of intelligence. This idea of considering multiple views of intelligence has helped educators look at intelligence from a less rigid, more expansive perspective. I considered how the relatively new concept of naturalistic intelligence, which is the cognitive potential to process information that is exhibited by expert naturalists, might influence the design of undergraduate biology curricula. Naturalistic intelligence can be fostered in undergraduate biology students by emphasizing the need for well-rounded scientific naturalists; developing curricula that involves students in outdoor inquiry-based projects; and helping students learn how to observe both the natural world and their own learning, skills that are essential to developing expert naturalistic knowledge. Professors, graduate students, and administrators can improve the naturalistic intelligence of undergraduate biology students by giving these students opportunities to be involved in outdoor research. Time spent outdoors alone and among people with expertise in natural history, ecology, and conservation biology will have important influences on the knowledge and skills biology undergraduates learn, the careers they pursue, and the contributions they make to conserving Earth's biodiversity. },

The research adopted a qualitative approach with participant observation, and the data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed based on Interpretative Descriptive Analysis. The results indicate that the managers have basic knowledge of the concept and characteristics of students with Giftedness, according to Renzulli’s Three-Ring Theory, Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences, and current legal documents. However, discrepancies were identified regarding institutional support provided by the campus and the identification and support of students with Giftedness. In conclusion, it is necessary to deepen and professionalize the processes related to Giftedness through continuous education that encompasses both theoretical and practical aspects of this field and meets the needs of the managers surveyed. },

Seventy freshmen majoring in IT at the department of M, H University participated in this study and the basic major subject required for the department was Computer Language: I-C Language. Eight intelligence areas less controversial in Gardner’s multiple intelligence theory were used; academic adjustment was manipulatively defined as the degree of adjustment for the department and the major among undergraduate students; and pleasure, flow, familiarity and relevance to the major, academic achievement, and major satisfaction were selected as variables through literature review. The undergraduate students majoring in IT showed high levels of interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence, with insignificant gender differences. Significant correlations were found between multiple intelligence and academic adjustment. In particular, while pleasure and flow in C programming were found to be at low levels in academic adjustment, the significant correlation between linguistic intelligence in multiple intelligence and flow in C language was a very interesting finding. While significant correlation was not found between multiple intelligence and academic achievement, students who were more highly aware of the relevance to the major and who were more familiar with C language showed higher academic achievement. Lastly, limitations of this study were discussed; on the basis of the results, suggestions were made about prescriptive strategies to improve academic achievement for undergraduate students majoring in IT. },

  abstract={ Study Objectives: This study aimed to examine the relationship between cognitive behavioral physical activity and multiple intelligence levels of athletes in different team sports. Methods: The sample of the study consisted of 518 athletes dealing with different team sports. As a data collection tool, Cognitive Behavioral Physical Activity Scale developed by Schembre et al. (2015) and adapted into Turkish by Eskiler et al. (2016), and Multiple Intelligence Scale developed by Gardner (1990) and adapted into the Turkish Selcuk et al. (2003), were used. In the analysis of the data, it was determined that the data did not show normal distribution as a result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and non-parametric analysis was used. Mann-Whitney U test was used for paired comparisons and the Kruskal Wallis-H test was used for multiple comparisons. Results: It was determined that female athletes had higher result expectation from cognitive behavioral physical activity sub-dimensions, while males' personal disabilities were higher than female. When multiple intelligence levels were examined, although the logical intelligence levels of male were higher than female, it was found that their kinesthetic intelligence levels were higher. Also, when compared according to sports branches, it was found that the logical intelligence levels of basketball players were higher than futsal players. Finally, when the relationship between the cognitive behavioral physical activity levels of athletes and multiple intelligence sub-dimensions was examined, it was found that there was a positive relationship between cognitive behavioral physical activity and intelligence types. These results showed that as the level of cognitive behavioral physical activity increased, the mean that individuals can obtain from the multiple intelligence scale can increase. Conclusion: These results suggested that especially sedentary individuals should be directed to physical activities starting from adolescence. Thus, they can contribute to the development of multiple intelligences. },

This study finds that work passion is a key intermediary that transforms multiple intelligences (i.e. cultural, emotional, and political intelligences) to increased work passion, which consequently boosts job performance. The positive moderation of LGO training on the relationship between cultural intelligence and work passion suggests how LGO training intensifies a deep understanding of cultural intelligence and consequently boosts work passion. The negative moderation of LGO training on the relationship between political intelligence and work passion suggests that political intelligence is less influential on work passion when the training is greatly enforced. },

Results indicated that teachers were profoundly affected by these approaches: They felt that their teaching experienced a shift in paradigm to a more learner-centered classroom; they were once again energized and enthusiastic about their pedagogy; and they felt that they were able to reach more students. Students demonstrated keen interest in MI concepts and showed positive responses to the increased variety of instructional strategies used in their foreign language/ESL classrooms. For the pilot study, student achievement data are inconclusive. Phase II of the MI study will attempt to collect more detailed data related to classroom performance and student achievement. An unanticipated outcome of this research project was the positive impact it had on student attitudes and motivation to learn. },

Two hundred ninety-four children (aged 5 to 7) participated in this study. A set of Gardner's Multiple Intelligence assessment tasks based on the Spectrum Project was used. To analyze the invariance of a general dimension of intelligence, the different models of behaviours were studied in samples of participants with different performance on the Spectrum Project tasks with Multi-Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis (MGCFA). Results suggest an absence of structural invariance in Gardner's tasks. Exploratory analyses suggest a three-factor structure for individuals with higher performance levels and a two-factor structure for individuals with lower performance levels. },

  abstract={ Background: The teaching and learning of clinical skills is a key component of nurse education programmes. The clinical competency of pre-registration nursing students has raised questions about the proficiency of teaching strategies for clinical skill acquisition within pre-registration education.Objectives: This study aimed to test the effectiveness of teaching clinical skills using a multiple intelligences teaching approach (MITA) compared with the conventional teaching approach.Design: A randomised controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomly allocated to an experimental group (MITA intervention) (n = 46) and a control group (conventional teaching) (n = 44) to learn clinical skills.Setting: Setting was in one Irish third-level educational institution.Participants: Participants were all first year nursing students (n = 90) in one institution.Methods: The experimental group was taught using MITA delivered by the researcher while the control group was taught by a team of six experienced lecturers. Participant preference for learning was measured by the Index of Learning Styles (ILS). Participants' multiple intelligence (MI) preferences were measured with a multiple intelligences development assessment scale (MIDAS). All participants were assessed using the same objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) at the end of semester one and semester two. MI assessment preferences were measured by a multiple intelligences assessment preferences questionnaire. The MITA intervention was evaluated using a questionnaire.Results: The strongest preference on ILS for both groups was the sensing style. The highest MI was interpersonal intelligence. Participants in the experimental group had higher scores in all three OSCEs (p < 0.05) at Time 1, suggesting that MITA had a positive effect on clinical skill acquisition. Most participants favoured practical examinations, followed by multiple choice questions as methods of assessment MITA was evaluated positively.Conclusion: The study findings support the use of MITA for clinical skills teaching and advance the understanding of how MI teaching approaches may be used in nursing education.

  abstract={ In this message-saturated world, the transition from a literacy-based culture to a digital one has brought unintended collateral consequences of invention, discovery with convenience, and efficiency.However, it has simultaneously worsened typical spasmodic acts and taken away the importance of the depth of thought processes and time-consuming viewing processes. The digital mode of reading, for temporally greater effectiveness causes brain-on-autopilot and the overabundance of information consequently brings about a scarcity of attention, which is reaching a critical level. These side effects come from the immanent plasticity of human brain. The generation of the age of digital culture does not have a chance to foster their powers of observation and deep-thinking processes and to form and develop their belief systems, which gradually weakens the power of analogous thinking and critical thinking. In this respect, this study examines various theories and practices including those of Maryanne Wolf concerning digital literacy and the brain, Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences, and Abigail Housen's aesthetic developmental stages to demonstrate the impact of education through art appreciation on the promotion of reasoning, analogous and critical thinking skills that require active brains. In conclusion, I suggest timely proper ways of teaching based on art appreciation with an emphasis on the aspect of spatial intelligence and multiplicity in art as a road map for the generations of the digital age. },

  abstract={ Advertising industry is perceived to be an industrial organization that aims to produce a creative communication planning and advertisements. Thus, advertising agencies ought to hire creative employees and to cultivate and train them in order for the company competency to meet the clients needs for successful brand communications. In doing so, ad agencies have to comprehend the individual employees’ competencies and traits as they manage the personnel to be deployed individually to the appropriate jobs. This paper purposed to find out how workers in different functions differ in terms of multiple intelligences and to delve into how they relate to job fitness perception, perceived job performance and job satisfaction. The differences in two functions, account executive and creative, are also analysed.The results are as follow. First, for the account executives, Logic-Mathematical, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal Intelligences are relatively higher than Naturalistic and Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligences. As for the creative team workers, Visual-Spatial, Linguistic, Intrapersonal, Interpersonal Intelligences are relatively higher than Naturalistic, Bodily-Kinesthetic and Logic-Mathematical Intelligences.Secondly, the comparative analysis of the two job functions showed significant contrasts in terms of three intelligences of Visual-Spatial, Intrapersonal and Naturalistic Intelligences. Third, Interpersonal, Linguistic and Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligences have positive relation to job-competence fitness, while Naturalistic Intelligence bears negative relation to it. Linguistic and Interpersonal Intelligences are positively related to job fitness.Naturalistic Intelligence relates to job fitness negatively. As for the creative workers, Intrapersonal and Visual-Spatial Intelligences are positively related to job-competence while Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Intelligences relate positively to job-fitness perceptions.Fourth, as for the relationship between job performance perception and the multiple intelligences, we found out significantly positive relations with Linguistic, Intrapersonal, Interpersonal and Logic-Mathematical Intelligences for account executives. While, creative workers relate it to Interpersonal Intelligence.Finally, as for the job satisfaction, Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Intelligences show positive relation to it while Visual-Spatial Intelligence has a negative relation. As for the creative workers Interpersonal Intelligence is found to be negatively related to job satisfaction.The results of study may be criticized for seemingly a little obvious and confusing as the study of its kind has never been dealt in the advertising literature. However, since the early 90s, Multiple Intelligence theory has long been applied to the other major disciplines such as education and psychology, and it produced very useful insights and implications for management, education and psychology fields. Advertising is a salient field of communications study. Cultivation of creativity and personnel management are so pivotal in advertising communication industry that application of multiple intelligence may further our understanding the particular communication industry and the people at work. },

  abstract={ Educational reform in China has brought about many Western educational approaches for teachers to consider as part of their pedagogy. An example of this is the theory of multiple intelligences (MI theory). This paper presents how a theory grounded in a Western context is locally reconceptualised by kindergarten teachers who grew up in a different context. A qualitative case study was selected to investigate seven kindergarten teachers' understandings of MI theory in China. Three methods were employed to gather data; semi-structured interviews, field observations and documentation. Evidence from the three sources were analysed using a thematic approach. This paper reports contextual factors that had an influence on the teachers' understandings of MI theory and thus its implementation, and argues that the introduction of new educational theories or approaches should be grounded in the local context in which the teaching will be embedded. },

Furthermore, it is investigated the potential role of legal education in overcoming that conception of Law, uncompromised with its raison d'etre. The problem identified is the concealment of prejudices under the guise of neutrality of what legal positivism considers to be beforehand given to it. The question answered is: how can legal teaching contribute to overcoming the legal positivist myth of the given, which today is viewed as theoretical common sense? The research is qualitative bibliographical. It promotes a philosophical approach to the problem, in a complex post-Gadamerian hermeneutic paradigm - to the detriment of the classic deductivist legal positivist paradigm. The following results are presented: legal teaching, in order to overcome the legal positivist postulate of neutral data, needs to focus on activities that exercise prudence, stimulating, with regard to the perception of the acts of the present, all the multiple intelligences of the human being. },

  abstract={ Recently Gardner's ‘Multiple Intelligences(MI) Theory’ together with ‘Teaching for Understanding(TFU) Theory’ is quite influential in the area of education. In spite of its influences on education, meanings of some concepts are confusing and their relationship with other related educational concepts are not clear. The purpose of this article is to clarify Gardner's MI theory and TFU theory, and examine their implications especially on knowledge education.First, Gardner's basic ideas of MI theory and its educational implications are explained. Gardner emphasizes individualized schooling, suggesting new role and structure of schooling. Secondly, the concept of ‘intelligence’ is analyzed in comparison with other knowledge related concepts. And Gardner's claim that ‘intelligence can be educational contents’ is examined. It is pointed out that intelligences by themselves cannot be contents of education unlike ‘domain’. And it is also pointed out that the list of multiple intelligences neither can be necessary nor sufficient elements of subject-matter.Thirdly, I examine the TFU theory, clarifying the meaning of ‘understanding’. It is explained that ‘understanding’ has not only conceptual aspect but also performative aspect, which distinguishes Gardner's theory from the traditional structures of knowledge theory. Here the nature of the TFU theory is explained in comparison with other educational theories. Especially the similarity and difference with structures of knowledge theory is examined. Finally, it is discussed whether Gardner's claim that ‘understanding’ is the purpose of education can be justified. },

The investigation is quantitative in character, carried out via a survey, using SPSS and JASP for the data analysis. The results show that these prospective teachers feel greater rejection toward Physics and Chemistry than toward Biology and Geology (they mainly express enthusiasm for the latter). It is possible to establish differences in the emotions that the prospective teachers feel toward science depending on which path they took in their pre-university studies (Arts or Sciences). There are correlations between feeling positive emotions and having greater self-efficacy in teaching those same scientific topics. Those who feel negative emotions, such as fear or rejection, toward Physics and Chemistry have lower self-efficacy. There are correlations between having greater self-efficacy when teaching science and having a predominantly logical-mathematical intelligence. There is also a relationship between having a predominantly logical-mathematical type of intelligence and feeling more positive emotions toward sciences. Predictors of emotional dimension and self-efficacy have been also explored by multiple regression. },

  abstract={ This paper discusses how adult literacy educators chose to apply multiple intelligences (MI) theory. The findings fall into two categories of teachers' interpretation, MI-inspired instruction, and MI reflections. The resulting findings were that these MI-inspired teaching approaches helped to reduce teacher directedness and increase student control and initiative; to increase the authenticity of the learning experiences; and to make learning meaningful, or relevant to students. Having MI-based learning choices made adult learners more confident about taking greater control of their own learning, and it pushed teachers to allow that to happen. Choice-based activities were instrumental in increasing the relevance and meaning of lessons and in reducing teacher directedness. Understanding the link between students' perceptions of their abilities and their actual academic performance, AMI teachers set out to create opportunities for students to reflect about their strengths, weaknesses, and interests connecting them to the MI framework. Our data suggest that this, and other forms of MI reflections, prompted adult learners to see themselves as learners in a, more positive light after identifying and reflecting on, their own abilities. A is was particularly the case when they were able to apply their abilities to successful learning strategies in the classroom. },

  abstract={ Abstract Within elementary schools, arts education should be the education that must focus on developing creative and logical thinking instead of producing the field experts. In this perspective, photography in elementary schools should have the educational aim that nurtures to develop those elementary school students' creative, logical thinking capabilities. In other words, the education in elementary schools must proceed to create an environment to educate all of the elementary school students.Based on the theories of sprit-brain research and theory of multiple intelligences,the aim of photography in elementary schools is set up on the creatively, sensitively art friendly education and integrated education of logic and experiment.Furthermore, considering each individual learner's disposition and each school's circumstances, the composition of educational courses and drawing the learning model are selected for critical factors. With this, photography is very effective tool to nurture 9 different types of intelligence that is divided by the theory of multiple intelligences. It is judged that the possession of various ways to teach the field of photography and their contents would be very effective.To approach the educational model within photography, it should be conducted with the model of creatively, sensitively art friendly education (4 steps,understanding-experiment-application- organization); moreover, it could also be approached with the model for the integrated education of logic and experiment (5steps, understanding-experiment-suggestion-application-organization). Also, one must be careful to select while designing the academic model since this research suggests that those typical learning models have their own viewpoints.The first suggestion on the PBL learning model is about the learning model. The second model of scavenger hunt learning model is about the tool application learning model. The third one is the cooperative learning model, which can also be characterized with the TGT learning model and STAD model. These two models are based on the viewpoint of class progress. Thus, these learning models allow people to understand that it would be very advantageous to have the photography class within elementary education and each school's desire to build compatible.Finally, the teaching style of the photography class in elementary school can be changeable, depending on the decision of the types of learning models. At the beginning, it is essential to design and select the educational plan from the semester's educational aim, learning models, and development of photography education. Therefore, the educational means must organize in accordance with the abovementioned learning models. The class must be proceeded with the consideration of students' environmental conditions with the anticipation of maximum educational effect as possible. Therefore, the photography class in primary schools can be expected with the most systematic and effective outcome as possible. In addition, it also allows to have compatible in the school system. To a greater extension, a demand from the education system for an accurate response will be able to be arranged },

  abstract={ The purpose of this paper is to introduce strategies for understanding and using‘Intelligence Profiles based upon Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory(MI Profile)', MIProfiles are designed to combine deliberatively with the strength and weakness of anindividual's intelligence domains in order to actualize an ideal of learner-centered education.To obtain this end, first, the researcher identified two approaches to an introduction ofMI Profile: laser- and searchlight-profiles. The former indicates certain superior capacitiesdemonstrated by some learners in certain intelligence domains. In contrast, the lattersuggests types of intelligence domains inherent in most learners. Research showed thatboth approaches made it possible to identify profiles for all learners for the shake ofeducational purposes. MI Profile is likely that all learners keep inherently uniquecapacities on their own that should be celebrated and respected. Secondly, as taking acloser look at ways in which MI profiles are used in the educational context, theresearcher explored two additional strategies: intelligence combinations within a learnerand across learners. In regard to the combination within a learner, research found thatthrough the process of making a learner aware of his/her strong and weak intelligences,the learner's weak intelligence domain(s) has ended up being developmentally supplementedas he/she actively utilized his or her strongest intelligence domain(s) over time. This wayof combination is seen as useful in that educators can flexibly differentiate MI Profile infavor of each individual's uniqueness. On the other hand, there was evidence that theway of combining properly different intelligences across learners in cooperative learningcontext could make learning occur at maximum. In conclusion, the four strategic approachesto MI profile provide for two significant educational premises that help us move one stepforward actualizing an ideal of learner-centered education, that is to say, respect for anindividual's uniqueness and a possibility of change. },

  abstract={ Previous studies have shown that when parents estimate their own and their children's overall IQ (general intelligence), fathers estimate their own scores significantly higher than mothers estimate their own scores, and both parents estimate their sons' IQ higher than their daughters' (Furnham & Gasson, 1998). This study looks at differences in parental estimation of children's multiple intelligences based on Gardner's (1983) seven-dimensional model. In all, 112 parents estimated their own and their sons' and daughters' ability on each of seven specific dimensions (verbal, mathematical, spatial, musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal). As before, males (fathers) rated themselves as more intelligent on mathematical and spatial intelligence than females (mothers) raced themselves on these intelligences. Results indicated that differences in perception of children's intelligence lay only in the areas of mathematical and spacial intelligence, which may be conflated with lay concepts of overall intelligence. Overall, mothers rated their children higher on mathematical and spatial intelligence than did fathers, and both parents indicated that they thought their sons more numerate than their daughters. This result was stronger for the first child than for the second, suggesting the cultural significance attached to first-born sons (primogeniture). },

To this end, pre-schoolers in Nuri class at Sarang Day Care Center were chosen for applying multiple intelligences theory to the project approach, in order to determine the actual project that utilizes the strengths of the pre-schoolers as well as the continuous and integrated process phenomena of the portfolio assessment process. Over a period of one year and seven months, 26 children in Nuri class aged 4 to 5 were studied in participation observation in a qualitative single case study. The portfolio assessment data was analyzed; systematic data collection and analysis were made possible by in-depth interviews with two teachers and parents and document analysis. The research findings can be summarized as follows. The first, Children’s creativity, in other words, the expression of creative production, appeared dominantly under an assessment system that applied diverse methods of self-assessment and direct parental participation. The second, the continuous self-assessment and reflection encouraged children to adopt reflective thinking and thereby display their meta-cognition, that is, their “thinking strategies that promote knowledge of knowledge”;the continuous assessment process even showed the gradual development. The third, By exploring and assessing his strengths revealed through immersion, the preschoolerthrough active participationbecame an active learner that took the lead in learning, absorbed in the “flow of self-activities.”The fourth, That is to say, as a result of being invested with positive self-worth through increased interest and compliments, as well as intimate interaction with teachers who provided opportunities for self-assessment, the preschooler came to express a strong sense of accomplishment and confidence, which led to greater self-worth. In conclusion, the diverse methods of portfolio assessment had positive educational effects by stimulating their future-oriented creative thinking and problem-solving, as well as emotional development and active learning attitude. },

  abstract={ Introduction: Specialized studies mention that extracurricular activities (including dance) contribute to the stimulation of multiple intelligences, on whose development the educational process and academic success depend. The aims of the study were to investigate the benefits of dancesport for the development of institutionalized children's learning strategies, and to examine gender-dependent differences in learning strategies, as well as to formulate possible recommendations regarding the practice of dance at the age of preadolescence, from the perspective of school success vectors. Methods: Through the School Motivation and Learning Strategies Inventory (SMALSI), we could observe the changes produced in children from the initial phase to the final assessment at the end of a dancesport program. The intervention took place over a period of six months with a frequency of two lessons per week, with each lesson lasting 60 min, and aimed to increase school motivation and performance, considering the learning strategies used by institutionalized children. Thirty institutionalized children, aged 11-12 years old, participated in the research, during which they did not engage in other extracurricular physical activities. The preadolescents were assessed using the School Motivation and Learning Strategies Inventory (SMALSI). This self-report rating scale measures nine areas associated with learning strategies, six of which focus on student strengths (study strategies, note-taking/listening skills, reading/comprehension strategies, writing/research skills, test-taking strategies, and time management/organization techniques), and three are aimed at student liabilities (low academic motivation, test anxiety, and concentration/attention difficulties). Results: The results show that the biggest improvements in the case of institutionalized children were recorded for study strategies, effectiveness of test-taking strategies, and concentration difficulties. Girls registered significantly better results than boys only in the case of study strategies and for writing/research skills (Mann-Whitney test was used). Discussion: The study demonstrates the benefits of dancesport practice for the development of institutionalized children's learning strategies, creating a foundation for the improvement of their academic performance and school integration. Conclusions: At the end of the dance program, significant improvements in academic interest were observed due to the testing strategies used. Better results were also obtained for the scales of anxiety and difficulty concentrating during tests, where average scores decreased significantly. },

For this purpose, a multiple intelligence test was administered to 214 young children attending a general kindergarten, kindergarten attached to an elementary school, or childcare center and 209 young children with developmental disabilities attending a special school, general kindergarten, and childcare center in 12 cities and provinces across the nation by their homeroom teachers to examine their developmental characteristics according to gender, age, and types of disabilities.The result was as follows: First, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence was the highest and naturalist intelligence was the lowest both in the young children with developmental disabilities and the young children. Secondly, it turned out that the multiple intelligences of young children were influenced by the main effects of gender, age,and area of residence and the interaction effects between gender and age, gender and area of residence, age and area of residence, and among gender, age, and area of residence. Finally, those of young children with developmental disabilities turned out to be affected by the main effects of area of residence. There was no statistical significance in the main effects of gender and age. But there were no interactive effects between gender and age, gender and area of residence, age and area of residence, and among gender, age, and area of residence.It was suggested that this study provide basic data for developing an intervention program to help young children with developmental disabilities take advantage of their strong intelligences and make up for their weaknesses. },

  abstract={ The integration and development of music curriculum signals have attracted the attention of researchers in real teaching scenarios. Based on the theory of multiple intelligences algorithm, this paper constructs a music curriculum integration and development model. This paper establishes a nonnegative matrix decomposition scheme, adds a constraint term that can reflect the smoothness of the time-varying gain matrix to the divergence-based objective function, and iteratively solves the problem of curriculum integration and development through the minimum optimization algorithm obtained by constructing the auxiliary function. In the process of simulation experiment, the optimal solution of each factor matrix was designed, the source music signal was reconstructed, and the sufficiently sparse source music signal was separated. The experimental results show that, compared with the parameter estimation without preprocessing, the parameter estimation with preprocessing is more accurate, the accuracy of the improved algorithm reaches 97.1%, the signal compression ratio reaches 0.656, and the enhanced signal can obtain at most 6 dB. The signal-to-noise ratio is improved, and the convergence speed is fast and asymptotically reaches the lower bound. It is suitable for parameter estimation of low-order and high-order autoregressive processes and effectively promotes the smooth development of music course signals. },

  issn={ 1976-0590 },
  abstract={ In the field of biblical studies, psychological biblical interpretation is neglected in comparison with other traditional criticisms or considered as an inferior method. Perhaps this is because the psychological criticism has a shorter history than the traditional theology, or because one has a prejudice that so-called spiritual issues cannot be treated psychologically. In that psychology attempts to understand human behavior, however, it may help to analyse the personality and behavior of biblical characters. This atticle methodologically treats David's personality as a unitary one described in the final text of the Bible.Several psychological methods such as multiple intelligences, trait theory, and motivation theory are used when we analyse David's personality and behavior.David is a representative who possesses several characters and multiple dimensions in his life. As well as he praises God in belief in Him, David is shameless in killing his servant Uriah in order to take his wife. He is apathetic to Michal, but he is sometimes very empathetic towards Saul's partisans. The complexity in David's life and behavior may derive from his personality itself, or from the history of the text on him when the texts were collected to one body. David has an excellent talent in the spheres of music, literature, politics, and combat; he is obsessed by the desire and ambition that common people cannot understand. Finally his dual or multiple motivations are integrated within the belief in God. All human beings as well as David struggle between light and darkness that exist in their inward. },

  abstract={ Background: Teachers of sexuality education can often be uncertain about what theoretical basis and pedagogical strategies to use in their teaching. Sexuality educational programmes designed by teachers can often show few evident theoretical principles that have been applied in its construction. Thus, there seems to be a dearth of evidence of ways in which teachers can use appropriate theoretical foundations in their planning and teaching in sexuality education.Purpose: This paper aims to suggest a way of providing such an appropriate theoretical framework for sexuality education teachers of young people aged 7-15 years of age.Analysis: Age-appropriate primary and middle school pedagogies based on two integrated educational theories, namely Anderson and Krathwohl's theoretical framework of learning and teaching, with Verbal Linguistic Intelligence from Gardner's Multiple Intelligences, were analysed and evaluated. Key considerations were the earlier maturing of girls and boys, findings from relevant literature about children and young people's cognitive capacities, as well as the relevance of curriculum content for upper primary and middle school students, and the concomitant need for better and earlier sexuality education.Conclusion: This approach, integrating Anderson and Krathwohl's theoretical framework of learning and teaching, with Gardner's Multiple Verbal Linguistic Intelligence, may be useful to assist health and sexuality education teachers in identifying and anchoring pedagogies in a more theoretically structured manner, thereby enhancing the quality of their sexuality education planning and teaching. },

For this purpose, the classroom was restructured to create MI activity centers based on individual intelligences. First, teachers are suggested using MI class opening activities for students who possess strength on different area of intelligences. Before starting class, the classroom can be divided either into intra MI classroom or into inter MI classroom. Secondly, Korean Language teachers can make MI lesson plans using “Youn’s MI Dabige model” (1. Determine MI lesson objectives. 2. Ask MI lesson objectives. 3. Brainstorm MI activities. 4. Invent MI activities. 5. Give MI lessons. 6. Evaluate MI lessons). Finally, MI lessons can be developed through nested, webbed, and nest-web mixed integrated curriculum models. It is concluded that teachers need to use students’ intelligence profiles. There are many ways of learning, but the best way is to use one's strongest intellectual ability. The efficiency of Korean language education can be enhanced by utilizing learners' multiple intelligences. },

The learning goal of this program was based on Howard Gardner's eight theories of multiple intelligences and acquiring artistic thinking habits, with an emphasis on program effectiveness and activation. In order to revitalize local culture and arts education, unlike general single arts subject education programs, out of the three main instructors with different artistic backgrounds, one of the three main instructors specializing in integrated arts education planned the program and conducted it with the other two on September 9, 2023. It is a family-participatory integrated arts education program consisting of 10 children aged 6 to 7 and 10 guardians, from Sunday to November 18, Saturday from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm, 1st to 9th sessions. Quantitative performance: 92% participation rate per session and qualitative performance: The content of this program, as evidenced by the lecture satisfaction survey results of high participants with an average of 4.8 points out of 5, provides opportunities for integrated arts education in the local community, improves class quality, and provides opportunities for music graduates. It will be an important reference material for obtaining specific ideas about career exploration and cultural arts education. Furthermore, the positive influence of artistic thinking habits through appreciation of famous paintings and music, science, history, mathematics, presentation skills, social skills, affinity for nature, self-esteem, creativity, presentation skills, and aesthetic sense can be confirmed on the early childhood development process. },

This review is designed to introduce ways of viewing nontechnical competence from the psychology of human capacity to current perspectives, initiatives and needs in practice. After an introduction to the tensions inherent in educating individuals for both biomedical competency and bedside or cageside manner, the paper presents a brief overview of the major lines of inquiry into intelligence theory and how theories of multiple intelligences can build a foundation for conceptualizing professional and life skills. The discussion then moves from broad concepts of intelligence to more specific workplace skill sets, with an emphasis on professional medical education. This section introduces the research on noncognitive variables in various disciplines, the growing emphasis on competency based education, and the SKA movement in veterinary education. The next section presents the evidence that nontechnical, noncognitive or humanistic skills influence achievement in academic settings, medical education and clinical performance, as well as the challenges faced when educational priorities must be made. },

Based on the results of multiple intelligence test,participants were asked to perform (1) a task related with one’s strength, (2) a preferred task chosen byindividual student, and (3) a randomly assigned task from a teacher. This study aims to address therelationships among the three types of tasks and to find an educational implication for geographyteaching. This study revealed that the mean score of preferred task was higher than those of two othertasks. It’s because the participants were more willing to carry out their preferred tasks with more activelyand enthusiastically than other tasks. Although an unfamiliar and new form of assessment systembrought a little confusion to the students, it helped them find their own interest, ability and theopportunity to be aware of their own potential. },

  abstract={ Six hundred and thirty-nine Chinese primary and secondary gifted students were assessed on their adjustment problems using the revised Student Adjustment Problems Inventory (SAPI-24). Students' responses indicated that intense involvement, perfectionism, unchallenging schoolwork, multipotentiality, and parental expectations could be relatively common problems among gifted students. Less salient was the problem of poor interpersonal relationships. While the notion linking giftedness and vulnerability to adjustment problems was not borne out by the data with traditional IQ measure, specific adjustment problems were found to be associated with specific intelligences, which conferred both increased and reduced vulnerability dependent on the adjustment problems involved. Implications of the findings for future research into the complex relationships between adjustment problems and giftedness or multiple intelligences are discussed. },

We prepared an activity program in mathematics based on Feuerstein's instrumental enrichment program and Gardner's multiple intelligences theory to increase excellence and creativity in mathematics for Omani students. We hypothesized that the success of previous programs based on the same foundations would generalize to Omani students. In an experiment, the experimental group received a special training and the control group did not. We then checked whether the pretest-posttest gain was larger for the experimental group than for the control group. The study sample was comprised of an experimental group of n = 35 8th-grade girl students of class nr. 8/1 in Aesha bent Abu Bakr school in Salalah, Oman, and a control group of n = 36 of 8th grade girl students of class nr. 8/3 in the same school. The differences in pretest-posttest gains were analyzed using t-tests, significance levels, correlations, and effect sizes. There were large and significant experimental effects in favor of the experimental group, showing these educational outcomes can be generalized to Oman. We note various limitations of the study and give various recommendations. },

  abstract={ Spatial intelligence corresponds to one of the intelligences of the model proposed by Howard Gardner in multiple intelligences theory. The viso-spatial intelligence is considered as the ability to think and perceive the world in pictures. People who have this intelligence have a great capacity to think in three dimensions. This intelligence allows a person to perceive images, external and internal, recreate them, transform or modify them, and decode graphic information. Chemical engineering is a profession that is responsible for the planning, construction and operation of chemical and related plants. Chemical engineers must be competent in the use of space either in two or three dimensions, for this purpose they must develop the viso-spatial intelligence, because they must interpret and create planes, read and interpret data, design equipment and plants, understand the spatial connection between the different part of a process, etc. However, we found that our students do not possess the necessary skills to interpret and create drawings and models because in our Faculty of Chemistry no importance is given to the construction of models, equipment and prototypes. This is why the authors of this paper assign projects to four-student teams. The projects consist in designing an equipment that involves calculations and interpretation of graphics, drawings and models. The survey that students have answered indicates that as a result they have improved their visio-space skills. },

For this purpose, this paper first examined MI and instructional models of web-based learning, which was based on constructivism. In order to verify the effects of this experiment, we proposed a web-based English learning and teaching model and applied it to the 5th grade students in an elementary school. After the experiment, we analyzed the effects that MI affects students’ English achievement. The results of the study were as followings. First, students’ intrapersonal intelligence, linguistic intelligence, musical intelligence, and spatial intelligence had a positive effect to their English achievement. Second, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, and interpersonal intelligence did not have a positive effect on their English achievement. This study indicates that all kinds of multiple intelligences should be thoroughly considered when we design and practice web-based English learning and teaching models. },

  abstract={ This study examined the relationships between components of leadership giftedness and multiple intelligences among 510 Chinese gifted students in Hong Kong. These students perceived their strengths in intrapersonal, interpersonal and verbal-linguistic intelligences, and their weaknesses in bodily-kinesthetic and naturalist intelligences. They also rated themselves higher on leadership flexibility and goal orientation than on leadership self-efficacy. In predicting the three leadership components, intrapersonal and verbal-linguistic intelligences emerged as common and significant predictors, suggesting that self-reflection and self-management skills as well as a good command of language use were important in leadership. Other significant predictors such as logical-mathematical intelligence for leadership self-efficacy as well as goal orientation and interpersonal intelligence for leadership flexibility suggested that critical thinking might be important for the sense of confidence or efficacy and the vision of goals, whereas relational or people skills might be important for the openness to different options. Students who were classified high on both verbal-linguistic intelligence and personal intelligences, high on one and low on the other, and low on both were found to be generally high, medium and low on all three leadership components, respectively. Implications of the findings for inferring different levels of components of leadership giftedness from specific intelligences and for developing leadership training programs are discussed. },

  abstract={ Self-learning process is an important factor that enables learners to improve their own educational experiences when they are away of face-to-face interactions with the teacher. A well-designed self-learning activity process supports both learners and teachers to achieve educational objectives rapidly. Because of this, there has always been a remarkable trend on developing alternative self-learning approaches. In this context, this study is based on two essential objectives. Firstly, it aims to introduce an intelligent software system, which optimizes and improves computer engineering students' self-learning processes. Secondly, it aims to improve computer engineering students' self-learning during the courses. As general, the software system introduced here evaluates students' intelligence levels according to the Theory of Multiple Intelligences and supports their learning via accurately chosen materials provided over the software interface. The evaluation mechanism of the system is based on a hybrid Artificial Intelligence approach formed by an Artificial Neural Network, and an optimization algorithm called as Vortex Optimization Algorithm (VOA). The system is usable for especially technical courses taught at computer engineering departments of universities and makes it easier to teach abstract subjects. For having idea about success of the system, it has been tested with students and positive results on optimizing and improving self-learning have been obtained. Additionally, also a technical evaluation has been done previously, in order to see if the VOA is a good choice to be used in the system. It can be said that the whole obtained results encourage the authors to continue to future works. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. },

  abstract={ Video games have a unique ability to engage, challenge, and motivate, which has led teachers, psychology specialists, political activists and health educators to find ways of using them to help people learn, grow and change. Serious games, as they are called, are defined as games that have a primary purpose other than entertainment. However, it is challenging to create games that both educate and entertain. While game designers have embraced some psychological concepts such as flow and mastery, understanding how these concepts work together within established psychological theory would assist them in creating effective serious games. Similarly, game design professionals have understood the propensity of video games to teach while lamenting that educators do not understand how to incorporate educational principles into game play in a way that preserves the entertainment. Bandura (2006) social cognitive theory (SCT) has been used successfully to create video games that create positive behavior outcomes, and teachers have successfully used Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences (MIs) to create engaging, immersive learning experiences. Cognitive behavioral game design is a new framework that incorporates SCT and MI with game design principles to create a game design blueprint for serious games. },

  abstract={ BACKGROUND: In the history of early childhood education (ECE), language is viewed as key in teaching and learning. Children in the ECE are mostly confined to verbal communication which, to a certain extent, restricts their imagination and inventive ability. Loris Malaguzzi, the founder of the Reggio Emilia educational philosophy, initiated the Hundred Languages of Children (HLC) as a pedagogical approach to enable children to interact and communicate. AIM: This study aims to explore the role of HLC through the experiences and views of the four ECE practitioners in the Gauteng province. Drawing on Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences, the author argues that ECE children possess different kinds of minds, and therefore they learn in different ways. SETTING: Two Early Childhood centres in the Gauteng Province of South Africa were selected for this study because they had adopted Malaguzzi's HLC approach to constructing concepts to help children structure knowledge and organise learning. METHODS: The author used one-on-one interviews to get ECE practitioners' experiences on using Malaguzzi's HLC. To corroborate the interviews' data, the author conducted classroom observations and document analysis. RESULTS: The participants viewed Malaguzzi's HLC as an enabler to meet the requirement of the two sets of curricula from the Department of Social Development (the National Curriculum Framework for children from 0 to 4 years) and from the Department of Basic Education (the Curriculum Assessment and Policy Statement for 5-year-old children. CONCLUSION: The findings show a paradigm shift, as children become active constructors of their own knowledge. },

From this perspective, self-esteem will play a determining role when it comes to strengthening or restricting the achievement of individuals’ goals. It is a great honor to share these reflections within the framework of the present publication of an institution as prestigious and influential as the University of Palermo. In this framework, we will refer to the way in which self-esteem is linked to the psychic capital of people and the way in which they enhance the use of the “neurological stock”, which we usually call “intelligence”. },

Therefore, first multiple intelligence areas and learning styles of 243 mathematics prospective teachers studying at a state university were identified using the Multiple Intelligence Inventory for Educators developed by Armstrong and the Learning Styles Scale developed by Kolb. Second, the data was appropriated for rough set analysis and we identified potential learning styles that a student can have based on the learning style s/he already has. Certainty degrees of the learning style sets were alpha(R)(D) congruent to 0.717, alpha(R)(C) congruent to 0.618, alpha(R)(AS) congruent to 0.699, alpha(R)(AC) congruent to 0.461, and these sets were found to be rough sets. Finally, decision rules were identified for multiple intelligences and learning styles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. },

  abstract={ Too many of our brightest and most capable students are sometimes caught in a system that places too much emphasis on linguistic, word smart intelligence or mathematical, number smart intelligence. Students at all levels of academic readiness from developmental to honors-are affected by the rigidity of this way of thinking. Focusing solely on these types of learning strategies has in some cases encouraged rote memory teaching strategies that may foster little or no connection to material, low motivation, and poor performance. Memorization-regurgitation is the name of the game for many students; not much value is placed on learning or remembering the material, let alone understanding it. The Multiple Intelligences/Learning for Understanding (MI/LfU) initiative at Glendale Community College is one approach to learning and creative assessment a dedicated group of faculty, administrators, and students have been involved in for the past 9 years. Incorporating MI theory across the curriculum, provided students with a variety of creative, imaginative learning options. Students became miniexperts and cofacilitators of learning as they gave performances of understanding of the academic content studied. Assessment for understanding was completed using a creative grading/diagnostic rubric. Reflective student and faculty evaluation provided invaluable insight into the learning and teaching process. Providing a forum for the exchange and dialogue of ideas, innovations, perceptions, and pedagogies is essential in the transformation of education and crucial in the dynamics and evolution of change. },

  abstract={ The goal of this study was to explore the raters' agreement and the effect of raters' and targets' gender on self- and parental intelligence assessments in the sample of Croatian twins. Twins were asked to assess their own and their parents' overall intelligence, as well as specific abilities from the Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences. Data was analysed to explore: i) twins' agreement in parental assessments and behavioural genetic analysis of the overall intelligence estimates; ii) gender differences in self- assessments; and iii) raters' and targets' gender effects on parental assessments. The twins' mean correlation in their assessments of overall parental intelligence was .60. The differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twin correlations were nonsignificant for all of the estimated abilities, and model fitting analysis indicates that hypothesis about genetic effect on parental assessment of intelligence should be rejected. The hypotheses about males' higher self-assessments for overall intelligence and for the masculine types of abilities - logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities - were confirmed. For the feminine types of abilities - verbal/linguistic, inter- and intra- personal intelligences - there were no significant gender effects. Both target and rater effect were found for the parental estimates of intelligence. Fathers were estimated higher on overall intelligence, logical-mathematical, body-kinesthetic and spatial abilities, while mothers were estimated higher on interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. The effect of the raters' gender was found for overall intelligence as well as for inter- and intra- personal intelligences, where males gave higher estimates of parental intelligences than females. },

  abstract={ This paper examines the affective domain of inquiry to conceptualize theoretically the inquiry theory for art education theoretically. For this purpose, the affective domain of inquiry is highlighted by exploring the limitations of the existing research on genetic artistic development theory, the aim of which is to describe children’s artistic development. After discussing the classification of affective domain in Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives, the concept of affective domain is addressed in terms of multiple intelligences theory, and emotional intelligence theory is explored to examine how affective domain relates as an example to the process of inquiry. The description of how an affective domain of inquiry correlates with the cognitive domain of inquiry then follows. Through this investigation into that correlation, it is emphasized that an understanding of children’s artistic development should be based on an integrated understanding of children’s inquiry process, which is affected not only by the cognitive domain, but also the affective domain. Ultimately, this paper aims to propose theoretically that the recent movement in art education that focuses on how to apply critical inquiry to visual culture art education should consider cognitive domain and affective domains of inquiry as well. },

  abstract={ This study is about the 1983 Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences (Gardner, 1983), in 2012 incorporates Spiritual Intelligence (SI or SQ) and demonstrates that it meets all the criteria that define each intelligence. The purpose of this research is to define the concept of Spiritual Intelligence and its competencies, and to elaborate and validate a measurement questionnaire. The concept and the basic competencies of Spiritual Intelligence have been defined through the systematic review of existing literature and the qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews carried out with outstanding people representing different spiritualities. The sample consisted of 22 adults of different religions and spiritual currents, mostly belonging to the Association for Interreligious Dialogue of Madrid (ADIM). The ages of the interviewees are between 30 and 76 years old; the mean age was 51 years. The distribution by sex was eight women and fourteen men. The selection of the informants was made according to criteria of experience, position, responsibility, information, communication skills, availability and predisposition to the interview. The semi-structured interview was used and for the analysis, the Content Analysis method, defined by Krippendorff (1990). Once the interviews were transcribed and reviewed, they were transferred to the qualitative analysis computer program Atlas.Ti 7.0 in the analytical phase of the segmentation of the texts, coding and grouping into categories. In the phase of verification and contrast of the data obtained, a double triangulation of the same was carried out. In the first, coincidences were searched and, in the second, the information was analyzed looking for the differences between the transcripts and categories determined in the bibliographic review by means of triangulation in the analysis of the texts. The results show the high confluence of the data collected and allow to define the IES and determining their competences: consciousness, transcendence, love, forgiveness, freedom, pain-suffering, meaning, gratitude and effects. The conclusions are important because they can serve as the basis for the development of an assessment instrument for the SI. },

  abstract={ The aim of this study was to determine the predispositions of the studied groups of students to work in the IT sector. The basis for predisposition assessment was their voluntary self-assessment of certain preferences, which are related to the theory of multiple intelligences of Professor Gardner. The study was conducted on a reference group of IT sector employees, assum-ing that they will be the model, to which the results of the study will be related. The method used to obtain data about the students' predispositions was a test carried out in an auditorium mode or online. More than 500 students from several countries were surveyed and interesting statistical material was obtained allowing for comparison between groups. The most important result was to find a way to sort the students into groups in order from most similar in their aptitude to the market pattern to least. This made it possible to determine the boundary beyond which students could be considered selected for a job in the IT sector. Statistical hypotheses about the similarity of the stu-dent groups to the reference group were verified. The results were both positive, confirming that a large percentage of students have predispositions to work in the IT market, and less promising. The authors are convinced that the method can be applied all over the world, as they examined groups in very diverse countries, taking into account, for example, location, education system, culture or religion. },

A total of 121 students from four eighth-grade science classes participated in this study. The experimental group of students (N=61) learned a unit of structure of matter in inclusive science classrooms in which theory of multiple intelligences (MI) was used as a mediator, aligned with the principles of Universal Design for Learning, to differentiate instructional strategies, assessment approaches and types of assignments, incorporating all students' strengths or intellectual profiles, while the control group of students (N=60) learned the same unit in traditional science classrooms. Changes in students' attitudes towards science over the time period (pre-test, post-test, and follow-up) were assessed using a Likert-scale questionnaire and individual interviews. The results of statistical analysis indicated that compared to traditional classroom, inclusive classroom using MI-inspired lessons significantly improved and maintained the students' attitudes towards science. The quantitative results were further supported by evidence from qualitative data gathered through post and follow-up interviews. This study has implications for the nature of inclusive practices in science classrooms concerning the value of students' attitudes towards science. },

  abstract={ Children's invented musical notations provide a fascinating window into their musical and metacognitive understandings. Using a Vygotskian social constructivist perspective that emphasizes the social nature of cognition, the purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the processes and products of children's notations as they notated a song and then taught it to a peer, a multi-level task currently unstudied in the literature. Thirteen Canadian children, aged 5-9 years, without prior music instruction, notated a song learned the previous week, sung it back, explained what they did, and then taught the song to a classmate the following week. The children's notations, as well as audio and videotapes of them carrying out the multi-level task, provided the primary data; audiotaped conversations with parents, teachers, and a school principal provided secondary data. Analyses generated descriptive and narrative portraits, which demonstrate the increasingly sophisticated representational strategies used by the children from three different age groups as they notated, refined, and taught a song. Select portraits are presented and discussed. Implications for research and practice highlight the value of the research task in eliciting children's multiple intelligences and collaborative problem-solving skills, and painting more complete portraits of their intuitive and emergent musical and metacognitive understandings. },

The subjects in this study were 350 parents of preschoolers in six different kindergartens located in the city of Busan, on whom a survey was conducted. The findings of the study were as follows: first, as for the awareness of the parents of the preschoolers on multiple-intelligence education, they placed an importance on that education in general. Second, concerning the state of their multiple-intelligence education, there was a strong tendency for them to rely on early childhood education institutions and study aids produced by relevant companies to foster the strength of their children. Third, regarding a time for early childhood multiple- intelligence education, they considered it advisable for preschoolers to start to receive that education at the Western age of 2 to 7, and they preferred teachers who had a good understanding of the psychology and needs of preschoolers. The parents wanted their children to receive that education, and hoped to receive parent education about it. },

  abstract={ The use of personalised learning environments (PLEs) and adaptive learning environments (ALEs) in education has increased during the COVID-2019 pandemic. Thus, the need of effective and high-quality PLEs and ALEs has emerged but developing such learning environments has some difficulties such as the need for a huge number of qualified e-contents. Generation of e-contents for these systems is a time-consuming and costly process. Moreover, presenting the same e-content for each student is not effective because each student can have different intelligence type. To overcome these problems, low cost, reusable and dynamic e-contents can be used for PLE and ALE systems. For this purpose, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was used to provide sequenced e-contents for PLE and ALE systems. This proposed system was used in a case study to investigate its impact on learning process. The performance of the proposed study was compared with analytical hierarchy process (AHP), which is another multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, also further statistical analyses were investigated. The results showed that 84.6% of students showed interest in the proposed system, so the FAHP method can be used for presenting personalised e-content effectively. },

Hence we develop, with the help of the concept of multiple intelligences, the idea of narrativity as a modality of cognitive functioning. },

The authors point 5 domains “Consciousness”, “Transcendence”, “Grace”, “Truth” and “Meaning” that compose the Integrated Spiritual Intelligence Scale [ISIS]. The present investigation aimed to realize a preliminary validation of the Portuguese version of ISIS. A sample of 714 subjects, 257 males and 461 females, aged between 14 and 81 years took part of the study. The implementation of the instruments was performed online and besides the use of Integrated Spiritual Intelligence Scale, we used also a socio-demographic questionnaire in order to characterize the sample. The results showed a Cronbach’s alpha values lying between 0.67 and 0.88. The value of Cronbach’s alpha for the total scale is 0.92. A penta factorial structure was found (“Religious and Spiritual Coping”, “Consciousness”, “Grace”, “Meaning” and “Mission”). In this preliminary version the domains were not congruent with the original scale. Although they are necessary further studies that focus on the convergent and discriminant validity, and a confirmation of the stability of the factor structure obtained in new sample, this work is an important contribution to the review of this new construct, and is assumed as a point of departure for further research in the area of Spiritual Intelligence. },

The subjects were 104 four and five- year-old children and their parents(208). Prosocial behaviors of only children were examined by individual interviews, and multiple intelligence and rearing attitudes of parents were recorded by checklists.This study showed four results. First, in regards to multiple intelligence related with prosocial behavior, only children who have better personal control skills showed high scores in logical- mathematical intelligence and lingual intelligence. Only children who have good personal relation skills also showed high scores in logical-mathematical, lingual and physical intelligence. Second, in prosocial behavior of the parents' rearing attitude, the loving attitude of the mother and personal relation skills, and preschool adaptation skills showed positive correlation. The loving attitude of the father with personal relation skills, autonomous attitude of the father with personal relation skills and control attitude of the father with preschool adaptation skills also showed positive correlations. Third, in relation to multiple intelligence and parents' rearing attitude, the loving attitude of the mother with logical-mathematical, lingual, space perception intelligence showed positive correlation. Autonomous attitude of the mother with space intelligences showed positive correlation. The loving attitude of the father with physical intelligence and autonomous attitude with lingual intelligence showed positive correlation, rejective attitude with physical intelligence showed negative correlation. Fourth, prosocial behavior with same attitudes of the mother and father showed higher score than with different attitudes. Personal control skills and preschool adaptation skills with behavior with the same attitude of the mother and father showed higher scores than with different attitude. Multiple intelligence(physical, musical, space perception, lingual except logic-mathematical) with behavior with same attitude of the mother and father showed higher score than with different attitude. },

This is a topic that is developed relatively rarely in pedagogical literature. In the theoretical aspects of this publication, the main parameters of the interdisciplinary approach, applicable to the education of students in 1st - 4th grades, which can be realized through literary and musical symbolism, are examined. Arguments supporting statements regarding the essence of symbols and the possibility of them functioning as denotation for one of the criteria for the manifestation and functioning of linguistic and musical intelligence, included in H. Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences, are brought forth. The focus is on the essence of the two types of symbols - literary and musical as means of forming and developing the respective types of intelligence. The publication also examines some practical and applied aspects, the main emphasis being fairy tales as a literary genre and program music, which are rich in symbolism. Specific approaches to pedagogical interaction are listed such as building musical characterization of a literary symbol, making sense of a specific musical work with the help of literary symbols, using literary symbols to realize musical content. In this way, it is proven that they are a real basis for the implementation of an interdisciplinary educational approach in the education of primary school students. },

Intelligences are multiple, universal and unique. It is necessary to develop them in each student in and out of the classroom. It is necessary to employ a holistic learning and to apply the technique of direct observation with an inferential dialogic guide for the acquisition of knowledge and abstraction in the students. According to their learning style in the formal and informal cooperative groups, the diverse intelligences can be identified with varied and interactive methodologies, reinforcing the interests detected by the teachers in the curricular process. },

  abstract={ The article investigates the ways of implementing emotional intelligence theory in future musical art teachers training. The methodological basis of the study includes synergetic, holistic, and hermeneutic approaches, the application of which allows finding out the ways of the future musical art teacher's emotional intelligence development. It is shown that emotional intelligence is an integral dynamic phenomenon that provides optimistic awareness, understanding, and control of one's emotions and emotions of other people; it also influences the success of communicative interaction. On the basis of the analysis of scientific literature on the issue under investigation and practical experience of training future musical art teachers, the ways of implementing the emotional intelligence theory in the professional preparation of future musical art teachers were determined, namely: activation of students' motivation for emotional interaction in the process of professional preparation; creation of appropriate artistic-educational environment; realization of a practically oriented, personalized, active creative process of development of the future musical art teachers' emotional intelligence through introduction of training technologies; involving students in constructive activities through joint events, game teaching methods, dramatization, etc.; learning self-talk skills, internal dialogue and self-affirmation; improving the effectiveness of artistic-pedagogical communication and professional training of the future musical art teachers; carrying out research activities. It is proved that the use of the provisions of the multiple intelligences theory in HEI for the development of emotional intelligence provides opportunities to students' self-cognition; better understanding of students' talents and abilities by teachers; stimulating creation of innovative teaching methods and forms; involving students in the creative learning process, taking into account the natural capabilities of all types of intelligence. },

  abstract={ This study analyzes Cheoyongmu based on Gardner’s multiple intelligence hypothesis, and what the study learns from the investigation leads the study to understand the early childhood educational value of Cheoyongmu. In general, dance is defined as an artistic activity for one moves one’s body to music in order to express thoughts and emotions of human beings. As long as we believe in such definition, it is possible for us to assume that Cheoyongmu is what has the greatest number of elements which could improve one’s physical motor intelligence and musical intelligence of all the other intelligences that had been presented by Gardner. However, the findings of the research said that in comparison with other intelligences, Cheoyongmu has more elements to develop those intelligences, such as the logical-mathematical intelligence, the spatial intelligence and the eco-friendly intelligence, of all the eight intelligences by Gardner. That was confirmed in that Cheoyongmu forms ranks in linear, a square, a circle, a diamond and others with five dancers as the accompaniment tells tangibleÂ·intangible spatial concepts when the dance works on the colorization of the cardinal points based on the traditional ideas. In addition, the dance makes use of colors, lines, blanks and others on this space, a ‘mask’, to symbolically describe the inner world of Cheoyong, and all of those which have been explained so far are determined to be highly related to the logical-mathematicalÂ·spatial intelligences. Add to that, Cheoyongmu has been symbolically expressing the harmony of all creatures, the changing seasons, the yin and yang and others depending on the yin-yang and five elements of the universe, and the study believes that such symbolism could enhance the in-depth understanding on nature. Other than what has been discussed on the above, even these elements that could develop the physicalÂ·musicalÂ·interpersonalÂ·intrapersonalÂ·linguistic intelligences are included in Cheoyongmu and yet, they did not appear to cover as much as the logical-mathematicalÂ·spatial intelligences and the eco-friendly intelligence do. However, the study verified that Cheoyongmu demands not only one single intelligence but also multiple intelligences that would interact to each other until the dance finally gets completed. In the light of that, the study argues that Cheoyongmu can make a contribution to the development of the multiple intelligence of children. },

Methodology: quantitative, non-experimental cross-sectional type. The sample consisted of 84 students (20 women and 64 men). To assess learning styles, the CHAEA-36 and the Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument were used. The Multiple Intelligences Inventory (IAMI-R), the Emotional Intelligence Inventory were also applied, and for academic performance, the transcript of grades from the subjects taken in the first semester by the students was used. Results: low to medium correlations were found between the active learning style and academic performance (r=-0.235), and dominance B is positively related to grades (r=0.270). Conclusions: Future studies with a longitudinal and experimental design are necessary, as there are some key skills for a comprehensive teacher that should be addressed from the first years of training. },

  abstract={ Abstract This qualitative action research intends to analyze the effects of differentiated instruction (DI) administered through a virtual learning environment (VLE) on students' English learning process. Differentiated instruction is understood as an approach that aims to foster every student's potential by taking into account their level of readiness, learning styles, multiple intelligences and interests. A group of 29 students from a private school participated in this research study. Journals data were analyzed through the use of content analysis and triangulation techniques, using Atlas.ti software. Findings avowed that DI through a VLE approach (DI-VLE henceforth) had a positive impact on students' learning process, meeting their needs and increasing their motivation. This study suggests that teachers and researchers in Colombia implement DI in their own practices to gain understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. The field of teaching English as a foreign language cannot be exception. The DI approach can constitute a valuable pedagogical alternative for the benefit of students. },

First, how were gender and region related to the career maturity levels? Second, what were the degrees of patterning of multiple intelligence levels related to the gender and region? Third, what were the relationships between the career maturity and multiple intelligences of elementary school students. The subjects for this study were comprised of 404 elementary school students randomly selected. The instruments for this study were administered Career Maturity Inventory(Crites, 1978) and Multiple Intelligences Development Assessment Scale(Shearer, 1995). The data were analysed using mean, standard deviation, t-test and pearson's correlation coefficient techniques. The finding of this study were as follows. First, the career maturity was statistically somehow related to the gender and region. Second, there were statistically significant differences on multiple intelligences between male and female students. However, there were no statistically differences on multiple intelligences related to the region. Third, there were also no statistically differences between the career maturity and multiple intelligences. Thus, the results of this study lend partial supports to the hypothesis that career maturity was negatively associatied with the degrees of patterning of multiple intelligences. },

  abstract={ This study investigates how bioecological variables affect the child's multiple intelligence through independent and interactional ways. The subjects of this study were 147 pairs of 5-year-old children and their mothers, and the Project Spectrum was employed to measure multiple intelligences. Each mothers was asked to answer a questionnaire on her child's temperament, her maternal parenting style, ‘goodness of fit’ and ‘the fit of child's intelligence’. Data were analyzed using a factor analysis and a hierarchical multiple regression with SPSS WIN 15.0. The main findings were as followings; First, ‘the goodness of fit’ to the child's temperament moderated the effect of a maternal parenting style that would foster child's dependency on the mathematical intelligence through interaction. ‘The fit of child's intelligence’ also moderated the effect of maternal positive parenting style to the child's mathematical intelligence. Second, in language intelligence, girls were more verbally intelligent than boys. In that regard, because the sex variable entails a combination of both inherent attribute and social-cultural effects, that result can be interpreted as an interaction between the individual and the environment. Lastly, a maternal parenting style that would foster child's dependency moderated the effect of the child's regular temperament on interpersonal intelligence. This means that the child's regular temperament can be a protective factor for the negative effect of a maternal parenting style that would foster child's dependency This study suggests that interactional factors such as ‘goodness of fit’ should be considered in studies involving children. },

  abstract={ The application of learning based on multiple intelligences has implications for collective awareness about diversity, uniqueness and equitable education. The objective of this study is to describe the level of multiple intelligences of students learning physical education in elementary schools, as well as to identify differences in the levels of each type of multiple intelligences based on the gender of the students.This study is a descriptive and comparative quantitative study. Purposive sampling was used to collect the samples. The 124 respondents included 57 male and 67 female students from Yogyakarta's Syuhada Mosque Elementary School. The instrument employs a questionnaire comprised of 21 statements derived from the substance of multiple intelligences. The instrument employs a Likert scale of 1 to 4. The instrument was developed using theory, with expert consultation, and its validity and reliability were tested. Descriptive statistical data analysis used frequency distribution to describe the state of multiple intelligences, and non- parametric Mann-Whitney Test analysis used to determine differences in multiple intelligences based on gender. Based on the frequency distribution analysis, it was determined that the highest frequency of intelligence corresponds to the following criteria: the low category is in logical-mathematical (22.58%), the moderate category is in visual spatial (40.32%), the high criterion is in intrapersonal (58.06%), and the very high category is in bodily-kinesthetic (54.03%). According to the Mann-Whitney Test analysis, The value of Sig > 0.05 indicates that the hypothesis that elementary school male and female students learn physical education differently in terms of their multiple intelligences (musical, verbal linguistic, intrapersonal, visual spatial, interpersonal, bodily- kinesthetic, logical-mathematical) is rejected. Meanwhile, the hypothesis that male and female students have different levels of naturalist intelligence when learning physical education in primary schools is accepted because the Sig < 0.05. Elementary school students' levels of each type of multiple intelligence in physical education are quite variable. The Mann-Whitney Test analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in the level of multiple intelligences (musical, verbal-linguistic, intrapersonal, visual-spatial, interpersonal, bodily-kinesthetic, logical-mathematical) based on the gender of the students, but there were significant differences in the level of naturalist intelligence in learning physical education for elementary schools based on the gender of the students. },

The theoretical framework developed related IL competencies to competencies for success as described by the psychologist Howard Gardner in his book Five Minds for the Future. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical framework was developed using the CILIP Seven Pillars for IL and Howard Gardner's Five Minds theory. Indicative connections between the Seven Pillars and Five Minds were identified by the researchers. The framework was tested through analysis of transcripts from qualitative interviews conducted with four small business owners. Findings Connections were found between the Seven Pillars and the Five Minds; some which had been projected by the researchers and others which had not. The theoretical framework aided description of and understanding of IL within small business workplace environments. Research limitations/implications - A small sample size limits the generalizability of the findings, and further testing of the framework is required. The findings do, however, suggest that the context in which IL manifests remains significant and should be further examined in wider and divergent contexts. Originality/value Using theory from psychology paired with a well-known theory of IL to develop a new theoretical framework is novel. The framework developed offers a new way of understanding the role of IL within the context of small business workplaces. },

Does learning consist of the incremental addition of individual bits of information into the mind? Or is learning an active process that transforms the mind of the learner? Among different theories on how people learn are: Behaviorism, Neuroscience, Right Brain vs. Left Brain, Communities of Practice, Control Theory, Observational Learning (Social learning theory), Vygotsky and Social Cognition, Learning Styles, Piaget's theory, Constructivism, Brain-based Learning, Multiple Intelligences. These theories are described in brief. All of the above mentioned learning theories may be applicable to some extent in the case of astronomy education in a planetarium environment. Especially the Multiple Intelligences theory can be tested perfectly while teaching in Planetarium and thus should be taken into more thorough consideration. It is discussed what a planetarium may offer to the audience with different types of intelligences, according to the Multiple Intelligences approach. },

  abstract={ This article present the validation the Self-Efficacy Inventory For Multiple Intelligence Revised IAMI-R in Venezuelan university students. 342 students participated voluntarily in Simon Bolivar University of Venezuela enrolled in period September-December 2012. The principal component factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis was performed to obtain evidence of construct validity. Additionally, a binary logistic regression was performed to obtain evidence of predictive validity. These studies confirmed a distribution of the reactants in 7 factors of instrument, which proved to be satisfactory and partially consistent with theoretical and empirical research related to the construct. Is concluded that validation of IAIM-R allows measurement of self-efficacy for multiple intelligences, consistently from statistical point of view, and allows the comparison of results between populations and variables of interest for development of social cognitive theory and inherent to the student and their motivation to demand specific academic or career issues. In items of predictive validity, instrument is relevant when it comes to technical careers choices of industrial and administrative areas, especially the size of logical-mathematical, kinesthetic and emotional self-efficacy. It’s recommended that future studies the development of research lines related to academic performance, motivation and retention in university system. },

  abstract={ With the enforcement of the ‘Personality Education Improvement Act,’ Personality Eduction has become mandatory in university. Personality Education is not just the program designed for correcting a student’s wrong behavior. Through the Personality Education, students should be able to improve their self-respect and responsibility, concentrate on improving their social attitude through critical thinking, and strengthen their ability to think and be open-minded so that they can cope with any situations by common sense and reason. In this article, the author presents how effectively personality education ought to be taught in Christianity related liberal arts centering on Howard Gardener’s Spiritual Intelligence. Howard Gardener’s Multiple Intelligence Theory has already become universal knowledge. Spiritual Intelligence(Existential Intelligence) based educational program is effective for fostering people who have solidarity, that is to say, those who can live together in peace. If learners become fully aware of this point, they begin to cultivate their mind having interests in other aspects of personality as well. In discussing Spiritual Education, they say that Knowing and Living are not separated but connected and that Holistic Spirituality that connects human’s internal spirituality with external spirituality ought to be pursued. This Holistic Spirituality has interests in and commitment to the disadvantaged and outsiders and also emphasizes the recovery of the Order of Creation by the Creator God and the reconciliation with the created world. But the problem is that university have no authority to force religion upon students and that the relation between Spiritual Education and Personality Education is ambiguous because the Spirituality concept is not clear. In Personality Education, practice is emphasized although it is a religious and spiritual education. Spiritual Intelligence is characterized by strong question of the purpose of existence and serving people, as noted by Howard Gardener. Spiritual Intelligence is sensitive to inner voice rather than wealth and fame and seeks higher value. Through Spiritual Intelligence, learners think about their reason for being and can live a happy life with others listening to their inner voice. It is expected that if this Spiritual Education is executed in Christianity related liberal arts and chapels due to such characteristics of the Spiritual Intelligence, it can play a central role in Personality Education. },

AI research has been coined by hypes and hubris since its early beginnings in the 1950s. For instance, the Nobel laureate Herbert Simon predicted after his participation in the Dartmouth workshop that machines will be capable, within 20 years, of doing any work that a man can do. And expectations are in some circles still high to overblown today. This paper addresses the demand for conceptual clarity and introduces precise definitions of strong AI, superintelligence, the technological singularity, and artificial general intelligence which ground in the work by the computer scientist Judea Pearl and the psychologist Howard Gardner. These clarifications allow us to embed famous arguments from the philosophy of AI in a more analytic context. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to provide data useful for the development of individual student athletes and the operation of school sports teams by comparing multiple intelligence differences between elementary school sports athletes, general students, and school sports athletes by sports events. To achieve this goal, data was collected from 115 elementary school student athletes in grades 5 and 6 and 177 general students from 8 schools nationwide participating in soccer, baseball, and volleyball. Statistical methods such as independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA were employed to derive the results of this study. Additionally, interviews were conducted with sports club coaches to clarify any ambiguous findings. The results of this study are as follows. First, student athletes showed statistically significant differences in three areas: bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, and intrapersonal intelligence compared to general students, with higher scores in these areas. Second, among student athletes in elementary school sports, student athletes in soccer sports showed statistically significant differences in four areas: bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, linguistic Intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, and intrapersonal intelligence compared to student athletes in baseball and volleyball. The findings of this study demonstrate that elementary school student athletes and general students show differences in multiple intelligences within several domains, and that there are differences in multiple intelligences between student athletes in each sports events.Through the results of this study, it was confirmed that there are differences in multiple intelligences between elementary school student athletes and general students, as well as among student athletes in different sports. This suggests that by understanding the multiple intelligences of student athletes and acknowledging the differences in intelligences among sports, effective operation of school sports clubs can be achieved. },

In this way, it is suggested teaching-learning method based on multiple intelligences theory which can increase learning efficiency in multilateral way and learning instruction method for teaching. Multiple intelligences hypothesis proclaimed by Gardner is that human intelligence is composed with eight patterns (musical intelligence, bodily Kinesthetic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, linguistic intelligence, space intelligence, Interpersonal intelligence, self-knowledge intelligence, natural understanding intelligence), which is efficient learning method in terms of music activity possible according to each intelligence character and connection with other subjects, various intelligence development. Musical intelligence for musical solving ability and musical intelligence is connected instrument play activity applied to Korean music. Bodily Kinesthetic intelligence to unite recognition and body is for dancing activity getting into the rhythm. Logical-mathematical intelligence to analyze the problem logically and to do math is for learning activity to count beat like counting numbers. Linguistic intelligence to learn and use language is for language rhythm. Space intelligence for sight-informational and spatial perception is to make concert. Interpersonal intelligence to socialize others is for ensemble.Self-knowledge intelligence to recognize self-states and self-evaluation is to evaluate performance.Natural understanding intelligence is for the music activity to sort Korean traditional music according to material. In conclusion, multiple intelligences having connection with other subjects are the efficient teaching-learning method for Korean traditional music education. For this reason, this researcher examined Korean traditional music education application method based multiple intelligences hypothesis and chose “Pungnyunga” as a music educational curriculum, suggested practical guidance plan. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to determine elementary school physical education teachers' awareness of the integration of multiple intelligences in the learning process in terms of teacher gender. Multiple intelligence integration is made up of eight sub-variables: logical-mathematical, linguistic-verbal, visual-spatial, musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist intelligence.This study is a comparative quantitative study. The participants in this study were elementary school physical education teachers from Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The Simple Random Sampling system was used to collect samples, and 58 teachers agreed to participate, with 36 male teachers and 22 female teachers. Data was collected using a questionnaire instrument with 29 questions and a 5-point Likert scale answer. All question items were deemed reliable because their r-count value was greater than r-table 0.254. On Cronbach's alpha, each sub-variable tested for reliability is worth more than 0.6. For normally distributed and homogeneous data, independent sample t test analysis was used. The Mann-Whitney Test is used to identify data that does not meet the prerequisite test. According to the results of the Independent sample t test analysis, the significance value of each variable is as follows: mathematical logic (0.735 > 0.05), visual spatial (0.880 > 0.05), musical (0.045 < 0.05), and intrapersonal (0.637 > 0.05). The independent sample t test results show that there is no difference in teacher awareness of multiple intelligence integration (logical-mathematical, visual-spatial, intrapersonal) between male and female teachers. These findings also show that there are differences in teacher awareness in the integration of multiple intelligences (musical) between male and female teachers. The significance value of each variable based on the non-parametric test using the Mann-Whitney Test is as follows: linguistic verbal 0.443 > 0.05, body-kinesthetic 0.273 > 0.05, interpersonal 0.826 > 0.05, and naturalist 0.563 > 0.05. These findings show that there is no difference in teacher awareness of multiple intelligences (verbal-linguistic body-kinesthetic, interpersonal, naturalist) between male and female teachers. The findings of this study can be used by the curriculum sector, school principals, and other related organizations to facilitate physical education teachers, especially male teachers, in training the integration of multiple intelligences in the learning process. Based on the findings of this study, it is hoped that further research into the integration of multiple intelligences in physical education will be conducted. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this article is to illustrate the use of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to explicate constructs underlying performance assessment tasks based on Gardner's (1983) theory of multiple intelligences. Data from Plucker, Callahan, and Tomchin (1996) were reanalysed using CFA. I analyzed several models based on the theoretical conceptualization of the authors, their exploratory factor analysis and the subsequent reanalysis of the data by Pyryt (2000). Models that allowed for intercorrelations among factors fit better than those without such correlations. Although the performance tasks appeared to measure their constructs as predicted, a model with three factors that combined Linguistic and Interpersonal Intelligence, rather than the four original factors, was supported. Higher order models indicated the presence of a general factor underlying the multiple intelligences. Although not conforming exactly to the original theory it appears that this set of performance tasks is a step in the right direction in terms of measuring multiple intelligences. Pyryt's concern for the influence of g was confirmed to some extent, but it appears that both factors and individual tasks retain sufficient variance to allow for the interpretation that they measure separate abilities. },

The article explores creativity expressed both within the field of neuroscience, with the beginning of the neurocentric era, and continuing with contemporary use of technology. It then surveys neuroscience's own exploration of the fields of creativity and religious experience, with ensuing limitations. The article establishes a dialogue between religious education and neuroscience, demonstrating how religious education provides neuroscience theory with grounded practice while also supplying ethical frameworks for neuroscience practice. It closes asserting that while currently neuroscience primarily endorses sound educational practice, future neuroscientific research should yield fresh horizons demanding ongoing creativity by religious educators. },

To that end, this study conducted a literature review and examined content validity with experts to develop definitions and preliminary questions for intelligence subfactors under each of the domains. Through an online survey, the preliminary test was administered to 128 university students in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, who were selected from convenience sampling. To test the normality of individual questions, this study examined kurtosis and skewness before analyzing the questions and confirmed that all of the questions met the standard of normality. This test was self-administered by 513 university students in Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, six metropolitan cities, and Sejong City, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm construct validity. The reliability of this tool was found to be good with a range of .758 to .885. The criterion-related validity of the test was verified using an adult multiple intelligences test administered to 61 participating university students. A high correlation was found across all of the seven intelligence domains, except for spatial intelligence, which confirmed the validity of the test as a multiple intelligences assessment tool. },

We will focus on some of these potentialities such as: categorization, representation, design and problem solving, specifically socio-technical. We are aware that there are others that can be developed, but in this article, we select the ones that we consider most relevant. The intention is to make them explicit. To develop the theme, we resort to epistemological loans from authors such as Lev Vigotsky, Howard Gardner and Jerome Bruner, representatives of the psycho-socio-cultural approach to learning. The development of potentialities in the Technological Education curricular space entails a pedagogical challenge that implies proposing significant school contents and activities, and thus contribute to the training of citizens capable of acting in the complex technological world, avoiding invisibility and familiarity uncritical of technology in individual and social life. Identifying these potentialities will be the responsibility of the Technological Education teacher training institutes according to the contents and activities selected and according to situated teaching and learning. },

  abstract={ Recently, the Korean Church has lost public trust in Korean society. Despite an abundance of Christian followers in Korea, the Korean Church has failed to make faithful believers. Under the current conditions, the Korean Presbyterian Church approaches this difficult situation by matriculating mature believers through catechism education. However, the possession of knowledge does not automatically translate to ethical behaviors. Knowledge and actions can be effectively harmonized in the context of Christian worship. In this same fashion, the Early Church tried to make sincere believers not merely by catechism education, but by liturgical catechesis. In this article, while studying the process and content of liturgical catechesis in the Early Church, I will argue that Early Church did not merely transmit knowledge, but developed practices to develop ethical beings through the congruence of education and practice. Through the use of Howard Gardner’s educational theory and Louis-Marie Chauvet’sunderstanding of sacramental symbols, I will prove the propriety and effectiveness of liturgical catechesis. },

In advocating the revised Sejong City plan, the government, including the president, the prime minister, and an advisory panel, encountered deep-rooted oppositioninitially from a minority within the ruling party, and then from residents of Chung-cheong Province and the opposition parties. The prime minister’s abrupt approach, without prior consultation with ruling party members, and his desperate yet hasty attempt to expand a policy coalition, was not able to reconcile the differences in this case. Incentives for opposing groups were not well established. The ruling party’s defeat in local elections made it even more difficult to move forward with the revised plan. Cognition theory, in particular a simplified version of Howard Gardner’s concept of seven levers for changing minds, provides a useful analytical tool for understanding this case. },

Futures intelligence is forward thinking, strategic, positive and empathetic. With its emphasis on future possibilities, futures intelligence not only provides practical ability to use the tools by which practitioners can plan and adapt for the long term but does this by taking into account societies' collective needs rather than those of self-serving individuals.

Also, many scholars such as Howard Gardner, Smith-Autauard,, Maxine Greene, and Margaret H'Doubler insisted on their educational philosophy. This research considered that their philosophies are related to integrated education in various ways. Their educational perspectives show that dance is not an independent course, but it is important ground work because dance has many possibilities. Aesthetic, artistic experience, and various teaching methods can be combined. Not only physical development but also linguistic, social, logical development can be improved. Therefore, in order to settle dance as integrated curriculum, it should not only focus on the physical aspects or bring different teaching methods from different courses without mature consideration. So, the unreflective integration should be denied, and many possibilities in which dance education has should be opened and researched through trans-disciplinarity. },

  abstract={ An RFID sensor is installed above the classroom door, and the scanning distance is set to 8 m to identify the composite campus cards of incoming and outgoing teachers and students, so as to realize automatic statistics of teachers' theoretical teaching workload and automatic attendance of students' theoretical class hours. The system automatically starts the multimedia equipment just 5 minutes before class and conducts self-checks on all devices in advance, reducing teachers' preclass operation steps. The multimedia management system of all classrooms is connected to the campus network and is centrally controlled by the cloud system. When the multimedia equipment in a classroom fails, it can directly instruct teachers to change to an idle classroom. Using the relevant theories of educational psychology and teaching theory, the WPBL teaching model based on the theory of multiple intelligences is expounded and demonstrated. It focuses on expounding theories and ideas; relationships and structures; and environment and resources and conducts in-depth discussions on relevant design rationales and architectural levels. Research has found that students are more interested in reading English than before. The reason is that in the English reading class of the experimental class, basically every student can have their own teaching activities, and more students like to participate in these activities. Applying the theory of multiple intelligences to English reading teaching has played a positive role in stimulating students' interest in reading. Multiple intelligence English reading activities play an important role in improving students' English reading performance. Through various teaching activities, the students in the experimental class are more interested and confident in the English reading class. Applying the theory of multiple intelligences to the English reading class can improve the students' English reading performance and reading ability. In order to apply the theory of multiple intelligences to actual English reading teaching, when designing personalized English reading activities, teachers should learn to combine the theory with the purpose and content of English reading teaching. },

The best predictor of their own self-estimated overall intelligence rating was mathematical and spatial intelligence. Mothers showed few significant differences in their estimates of their sons and daughters' overall or multiple intelligences. However, they rated their daughters' interpersonal intelligence higher than those of their sons, and their sons' bodily-kinesthetic intelligence higher than those of their daughters. The mothers believed that overall their children were about 6 IQ points more intelligent than themselves. Although mothers estimated their own spatial, inter-, and intrapersonal intelligence to be higher than those of their children, they also believed that their children had higher mathematical intelligence. },

Philosophy of education can help here by clarifying what flourishing consists in. This essay examines one aspect of this. It rejects the view that wellbeing goods are derivable from human nature, as in the theories of Howard Gardner and Edmond Holmes. It locates them, rather, as cultural products, but not culturally-relative ones, drawing attention to the proliferating forms they have taken over the past three or four centuries. It looks to aesthetics and art criticism as a guide to a philosophical treatment Of wellbeing goods more generally. It also takes off from aesthetics and art criticism in seeking to identify reliable authorities on the flourishing life. On this, it rejects elitist conceptions in favour of a more democratic model, emphasising its importance in education for citizenship. },

  abstract={ This paper shows an analysis of the entrepreneurship intentions patterns in the short, medium, and long term of Mexican university students. The entrepreneurship patterns analysis was carried out using a customized artificial neural network considering as inputs the self-assessment of multiple intelligences from an interdisciplinary perspective. Thus, many important findings reveal that not all multiple intelligences have a direct and proportional impact on entrepreneurship intention. In fact, Linguistic-Verbal Intelligence, Intrapersonal Intelligence, and Interpersonal intelligence are the types of intelligence that have the greatest influence on entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, the performance metrics of the ANN for classifying the entrepreneurship intentions are higher than the ones reported in the literature (i.e., accuracy approximate to 99.29%, precision approximate to 98.89%, sensitivity approximate to 99.53%, and specificity approximate to 99.01%). The paper contributes to the literature on the deep understanding of entrepreneurs' behavior concerning the strengths and weaknesses of their multiple intelligences. Besides, this interdisciplinary empirical work contributes to improving the design of methods and techniques to strengthen entrepreneurship from the earliest stages of students' lives and promote sustainable businesses. The most surprising finding was the minimal relationship of Naturalistic Intelligence to undertake sustainable and robust projects, which demands more detailed and in-depth analysis. Finally, some proposals are presented to improve the teaching process of entrepreneurship and sustainability, considering the artificiality, sustainability, and entrepreneurship involved in academic programs at universities. },

In the course of this evolution that starts at the end of World War I, three myths emerged that successively were refuted: a) the myth that intelligence is a unique massive capacity instead of a joint of several capacities which may combine in multiple forms; b) the myth that this unique intelligence in its totality deteriorates during old age, but later was verified that only some capacities named fluid intelligence are affected meanwhile others characterized as crystallized intelligence are constant or even improved; e c) the old age factor is the unique factor that influences the development or deterioration of intellectual capacities. To this last myth Lehr asserts that there are at least more nine influencing factors: Decline of the G factor , speed, innate aptitude, educational level, training, stimulating environment, health, successful life and motivation. },

She explains that although arts education has largely used multiple intelligences theory to substantiate its presence in classrooms and schools, this relationship has ultimately hindered the field of arts education's understanding of the relationship between the arts, human development, and learning. Emerging research on the brain's cognitive processing systems has led Groff to put forth a new theory of mind, whole-mindedness. Here she presents the evidence and construct for this frame of mind, how it sits in relation to multiple intelligences theory, and how it might redefine the justification for arts education in schools, particularly in our digitally and visually rich world. },

In this context, students used their knowledge and skills to help the group or partner to complete the tasks given. Students can interact with each other as they learn and the process of learning requires their verbal and non-verbal communication skills, cooperation and empathy in the group. Meanwhile educators can incorporate cooperative learning in groups in the classroom. On-MITT provides various tools to facilitate lecturers in preparing e-content that applies interpersonal intelligence. With minimal knowledge of Information and Technology (IT) skills, educators can produce creative and interesting teaching activities and teaching materials. The objective of this paper is to develop On-MITT prototype for interpersonal teaching activities. This paper addressed initial prototype of this study. An evaluation of On-MITT has been completed by 20 lecturers of Malaysian Polytechnics. Motivation Survey Questionnaire is used as the instrument to measure four motivation variables: ease of use, enjoyment, usefulness and self-confidence. Based on the findings, the On-MITT can facilitate educators to prepare teaching materials that are compatible for interpersonal learner. },

  abstract={ Primary school students with both giftedness and learning disabilities (SGLD) in inclusive educational settings may not always receive a differentiated curriculum. Differentiation in all-level classrooms is necessary for consistently meeting the needs of SGLD. There is insufficient research on teachers' knowledge of SGLD and differentiation in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. To fill this knowledge gap, we interviewed 9 primary school teachers in Madinah, Saudi Arabia. The interview data were analysed using content analysis. Our conceptual framework is based on the theories of Howard Gardner, who believe that all students learn in different ways. We also considered Lev Vygotsky's view that students learn best with instructions that meet their individual developmental level and address their zone of proximal development. Our findings suggest that teachers are willing to teach SGLD along with other students in the same classroom. Although they understand that differentiation is important, they were not implementing it for SGLD. Professional training and development related to teaching SGLD can improve the educational outcomes for SGLD. These results can assist teachers and educational personnel to seek optimal methods to identify and assist SGLD in Saudi Arabia and other regions. Finally, we provide recommendations for accommodations, strategies, and a differentiated curriculum for SGLD in primary schools. },

  abstract={ In this study, we compare the multiple intelligence of gifted students with the multiple intelligence of their children recognized by their parents. The subjects of the study are 118 students and their parents at the gifted education center affiliated with A University. First of all, there is a difference between the multiple intelligence of gifted students and the multiple intelligence recognized by their parents. Parents are highly regarded their children in all multiple intelligence components. Second, there are differences in multiple intelligence of gifted students’ gender. The difference in multiple intelligence of children recognized by parents depending on the gender of the student was similar to the student's results. Third, there are not much difference in multiple intelligence between elementary and middle school students. However, there is a big difference between students and parents in the elementary school group compared to the middle school students. Therefore, since multi-intelligence can be developed by individual experience and environment throughout one's life, an educational environment that reflects objective evaluation and student needs rather than parental subjective judgment should be created. },

The films used for this study were 5 educational films as ‘Black’, ‘The School of Rock’, ‘Freedom Writers’, ‘Detachment’, and ‘Whiplash’. All of these films were edited according to the study time of 30 minutes. After watching the films the students were asked to construct 3 types of works based on Howard Gardner’s the Art Propel(analyizing structures of scenarios and characteristics, making sense map). The result showed that students' learning motivation and effectiveness scores were improved after film based instruction and the differences of learning motivation and effectiveness scores between two groups were proved to be statistically significant. },

The sample consisted of 257 Navajo Indian and Mexican-American participants from kindergarten, 2nd, 4th, and 5th grades. Interrater correlations were performed to assess whether observers had given students similar or different ratings in the five activities of the assessment: Pablo(R) (spatial), Tangrams (spatial/logical-mathematical), Math, Storytelling, and Storywriting (linguistic). The results showed low and nonsignificant interrating correlations, indicating that students identified as gifted in one intelligence were not necessarily rated highly in the other intelligences, a finding congruent with the theory of multiple intelligences. On the other hand, the results gave rise to many validity concerns. The author recommends further studies before calling for the use of the DISCOVER assessment on a wider scale. },

The major implication of educational practices of children with disabilities based on Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences were as follows: First, addressing the education of children with disabilities through the multiple intelligences assessment method may help us to discover hidden strength. Second, MI-based assessments may provide IEP(Individualized Education Plan) for strength maximum of children with disabilities. Third, MI-based assessments was to explore the possibility that the best education adapted learning style of children with disabilities.

The objects were 629 male and female students from middle and high schools located in Gyeonggi-do and Incheon. Only 234 students among them were selected for an investigation to reveal the relation between the existing measurement tool of K-MIDAS and a newly developed tool of K-BKIS. The study, also, used exploratory factor analysis, item analysis, reliability estimation, correlation analysis and diverse statistic techniques for finding the difference of average between the two. The results of the study were drawn as follows; first, K-BKIS consisted of physical functions, physical effort and physical expression, and there was significant differences among factors. According to reliability estimation, it was found to have considerably high reliability. Second, boys showed higher bodily kinesthetic intelligence than girls. Moreover, when body strength was stronger and when a student obtained higher achievement in physical education, bodily kinesthetic intelligence became higher. Finally there was substantial correlation among existing K-MIDAS, which measured the same characters. From the above results, it was proved that K-BKIS was a valid assessment tool to measure bodily kinesthetic intelligence. },

Specific research questions for the study were as follows. 1) What is the overall average effect size of multiple intelligence programs on adolescent learning and what are the affecting variables? 2) What are the effects sizes and affecting variables of multiple intelligence programs on general learning as well as subdomains of learning? As a result of analyzing 23 related studies, the effect size of multiple intelligence programs on learning was estimated to be 0.978, indicating a large effect size. Also, in observing differences in effect size by study, predictor variables were entered in the level 2 model to find out the causes of such differences. Significant effect size differences were found between programs for preschool children and elementary students, as well as between programs for preschool children and middle and high school students. In addition, program effect sizes appeared to change according to the number of sessions. Lastly, the effect size of multiple intelligence programs on general learning was 0.663, and 1.099 for specific learning domains. Here, general learning refers to variables such as attitude or motivation for learning, level of academic achievement, and school adjustment. Implications of these results and suggestions for follow-up studies were discussed. },

  abstract={ Although Howard Gardner's theory of Multiple Intelligence was conceived in the 1980s and has been put into practice by some primary and secondary schools, it has received scant attention in higher education, apart from debates on whether or not the theory can be applied to students in tertiary education.' In this paper, I want to ask why this is so, and I will argue that since universities are undergoing rapid change, both in clientele and demands by society, Multiple Intelligence could be a vehicle by which some of these demands are met. I will also report on a survey of academics who attended workshops on Multiple Intelligence, and whether they viewed the ideas as useful pedagogical tools for higher education. After my introduction I will briefly outline the theory of Multiple Intelligence and explain why it can be considered an inclusive pedagogy. I then discuss the changes that are occurring in higher education, especially with regard to diversity of the student body and suggest that universities have been slow to accommodate this diversity in their teaching/learning strategies. I argue that Multiple Intelligence Theory could go a long way to bridging the gap. },

Using the pre-test-education-post-test experimental method, we applied the relational pattern to investigate the relationship between the 2 variables. The sample group of this study consisted of 34 children aged 5 to 6 years, 17 in the experimental and 17 in the control group. As data collection tools, the TIMI Inventory developed by Teele (1992) and an application (colour-bead system) containing assessments of the children's preferences were applied. The findings obtained in this study show that in 7 of the 17 children, the intelligence/skills area revealed by the evaluations of their preferences was similar to the results of the TIMI Inventory. },

Purpose is an extraordinary achievement. It is an ideal that young people are expected to accomplish by the end of high school, yet in our mixed methods study, only 26% of our sample overall (N=270 youth age 12-22) expressed a purpose. Still, purpose can be achieved precociously. Some youth achieve purpose much earlier than the norm: 11 6th graders in our sample showed a purpose. },

  abstract={ Disproportional minority membership in special programs has become a major issue in gifted education programs, identifying students who are gifted has traditionally been grounded in criteria emphasizing unitary measures of intellectual ability. An alternative perspective with promise for addressing concerns related to disproportion and bias in placement practices has emerged from the theory of multiple intelligences (MI; Gardner, 1983, 1993). While perspectives and opinions regarding multiple intelligences are plentiful, research on the effectiveness of assessment and instructional practices grounded in MI theory has been sparse. This research was designed to shed light on the problem-solving assessment (PSA) procedure, an application of MI theory focused on identification of students for gifted education programs. Scores and decisions grounded in PSA and more traditional criteria were described, compared, and analyzed. As in previous research, positive correlations were evident among scores for different types of intelligences and applications of another idensification criterion. More important, different groups of students were identified when using each approach; a more diverse population was identified with the problem-solving-assessment procedure. },

  abstract={ The main purpose of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of multiple intelligence-based tasks (MIBT) in improving university students reading skills and achievements. It employed a quasi-experimental design that primarily relies on a quantitative approach. Accordingly, a total of 60 students, who were selected purposefully, participated in the study as treatment and comparison groups. The experimental process was carried out with reading tasks that were designed in light of a model for teaching the skills using multiple intelligence-driven tasks. The treatment was provided for 12 weeks, in which three lessons were conducted per week. For similar weeks, the comparison group also attended lessons but followed the conventional approach of teaching reading skills. Quantitative methods were employed to analyze the data collected through tests. Specifically, T-tests were used to generate the output for the findings. Prior to analysis, a data normality check was carried out using Shapiro-Wilk tests, and a p value of .05 was used to determine the level of significance. It was found that multiple intelligence-based reading tasks brought a significant difference in the students' higher and lower levels of reading achievements compared to the conventional methods, with the effect size value ranging from moderate for reading aspects (i.e., reading for main ideas and understanding references) to strong for reading aspects (i.e., reading for details, guessing vocabulary, and inferring meanings from a text). The findings suggest that university teachers should use multiple intelligence-driven reading tasks to raise the comprehension levels of struggling readers in the context of the study. },

However, empirical studies on the construct have relied on text-based organizational identity descriptions, with little exploration of multiple intelligences, emotions and individual/collective identity representations. In this paper, we briefly review the empirical literature on organizational identity, and propose a novel method for empirical study involving structured interventions in which management teams develop representations of the identities of their organizations using three-dimensional construction toy materials. Our study has five main implications. By engaging in a method that draws on multiple intelligences, participants in this study generated multifaceted and innovative representations of the identities of their organizations. The object-mediated, playful nature of the method provided a safe context for emotional expression. Because it involved the collection of both individual and collective-level data, the technique led to collective constructions of highly varying degrees of 'sharedness'. Finally, the organizational identity representations integrated unconscious or 'tacit' understandings, which led to the enactment of organizational change. },

The paper is in two parts: the first exposes the racism that lies hidden in the small print of the new geneism, where wildly misleading assertions about genetic influences on education are proclaimed as scientific fact while race-conscious critics are dismissed as ignorant ideologues. The second part of the paper sets out critical facts about the relevant science, including the difference between the mythic and real meaning of heritability; fundamental problems with the methodology of twin studies; the little-known history of IQ test score manipulation; and the continuing use of a stylistic approach that Howard Gardner characterized as 'scholarly brinkmanship'. },

Through exploration, Gardner’s five minds are the essential prerequisites for new future society. But it is not enough for a person to succeed in future life. If we have understand Gardner’s five minds as objective knowledge, limit its scope to verbalism, and narrow down it's subject to respect for others, preparation of future society was rather cause human alienation. Because it anything but grasp connection of man and world, deep consideration of inner self, person's wholeness. Second, suggests that bring in non-dualistic view of ‘knowing' education and develop spirituality for a new future society. Though argue we changed from existing education to holistic education for development of spirituality. For this, suggests that must be expanded aims of education to spirituality, and must be provide the arts of fullness, activities on interconnection nature and society and world, manual training, contemplate meditation and contemplation. },

The lack of communication is not due to a lack of a sense of self, but of a lack of understanding of the neuro-typical community that people with autism are speaking a second language, and need help with the translation. },

A reference to the multiplicity of issues and ways to deal with them, through the different types of intelligence evoked by Howard Gardner, constitutes the starting point of the paper, in order to analyze the teaching of Restoration. Starting from the importance of pedagogical recovery in the teaching of this discipline (as well as of any other), the essay critically delineates the issues with the aim to open and address a possible discussion. It tries to fix some fundamental points, not only concerning the Restoration definition, together with its boundaries (operational and philosophical), but also considering the relationship with profession and with new technologies (used not only for communication but also fora deeper knowledge of the material data). Ultimately, the knowledge of the Heritage and the recalling of the reasons for its proper conservation (and Restoration) represent the key point to be examined and studied, starting also from didactics. },

The purpose of this research is to define the concept of Spiritual Intelligence and its competencies, and to elaborate and validate a measurement questionnaire. The concept and the basic competencies of Spiritual Intelligence have been defined through the systematic review of existing literature and the qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews carried out with outstanding people representing different spiritualities. The sample consisted of 22 adults of different religions and spiritual currents, mostly belonging to the Association for Interreligious Dialogue of Madrid (ADIM). The ages of the interviewees are between 30 and 76 years old; the mean age was 51 years. The distribution by sex was eight women and fourteen men. The selection of the informants was made according to criteria of experience, position, responsibility, information, communication skills, availability and predisposition to the interview. The semi-structured interview was used and for the analysis, the Content Analysis method, defined by Krippendorff (1990). Once the interviews were transcribed and reviewed, they were transferred to the qualitative analysis computer program Atlas.Ti 7.0 in the analytical phase of the segmentation of the texts, coding and grouping into categories. In the phase of verification and contrast of the data obtained, a double triangulation of the same was carried out. In the first, coincidences were searched and, in the second, the information was analyzed looking for the differences between the transcripts and categories determined in the bibliographic review by means of triangulation in the analysis of the texts. The results show the high confluence of the data collected and allow to define the IES and determining their competences: consciousness, transcendence, love, forgiveness, freedom, pain-suffering, meaning, gratitude and effects. The conclusions are important because they can serve as the basis for the development of an assessment instrument for the SI. },

  abstract={ Drawing on the theory of multiple intelligences, the theory of work adjustment and the framework of international adjustment, we examined the mediating effects of three cross-cultural adjustment (CCA) dimensions (general, interaction and work adjustment) on the relationships between three intelligences (cultural, emotional and political) and three expatriate outcomes (task performance, premature return intention and psychological well-being). A total of 237 expatriates were assessed. In our nine-factor model, we found that work adjustment had the most mediating effects on the relationships between the three intelligences and expatriate outcomes, while interaction adjustment had no mediating effect. General adjustment mediated the relationship between emotional intelligence (EQ) and premature return, and between EQ and work adjustment. Of the three intelligences, EQ had indirect effects on all three expatriate outcomes, while cultural and political intelligences each had indirect effects on task performance and psychological well-being. Our study is one of the first to examine the impact of three interpersonal, malleable intelligences and the separate mediating effects of CCA dimensions on multiple expatriate outcomes using a single model. Both theoretical and practical implications of multiple intelligences and CCA are discussed. },

The purpose of this research is to define the concept of Spiritual Intelligence and its competencies, and to elaborate and validate a measurement questionnaire. The concept and the basic competencies of Spiritual Intelligence have been defined through the systematic review of existing literature and the qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews carried out with outstanding people representing different spiritualities. The sample consisted of 22 adults of different religions and spiritual currents, mostly belonging to the Association for Interreligious Dialogue of Madrid (ADIM). The ages of the interviewees are between 30 and 76 years old; the mean age was 51 years. The distribution by sex was eight women and fourteen men. The selection of the informants was made according to criteria of experience, position, responsibility, information, communication skills, availability and predisposition to the interview. The semi-structured interview was used and for the analysis, the Content Analysis method, defined by Krippendorff (1990). Once the interviews were transcribed and reviewed, they were transferred to the qualitative analysis computer program Atlas.Ti 7.0 in the analytical phase of the segmentation of the texts, coding and grouping into categories. In the phase of verification and contrast of the data obtained, a double triangulation of the same was carried out. In the first, coincidences were searched and, in the second, the information was analyzed looking for the differences between the transcripts and categories determined in the bibliographic review by means of triangulation in the analysis of the texts. The results show the high confluence of the data collected and allow to define the IES and determining their competences: consciousness, transcendence, love, forgiveness, freedom, pain-suffering, meaning, gratitude and effects. The conclusions are important because they can serve as the basis for the development of an assessment instrument for the SI. },

This mixed-model study aims to describe meanings attached to Citizen Formation by a father, his daughter, and a teacher. This case studies let actors develop narratives which they use to build the meaning of Citizen Formation. Bruner's narrative technique is privileged, with its foundational concept of meaning.

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to explore the concepts and types of multiple intelligence (MI) theory and the Jigsaw Model. After examining the relationship, we used MI theory to develop the Jigsaw Model.This study proposes that using the MI theory, the Jigsaw Model has the characteristics in the following sentences. First, the Jigsaw Model was designed by a group of experts, who utilized the MI theory to create a standard. Second, while the current collaborative learning models are formal and abstract, the current models do not easily garner the interest of students. The collaborativelearningmodel, designed by experts using the MI theory, can more easily interest students. Third, the Jigsaw Model, by utilizing the MI theory, helps in procedures, such as problem solving, expertise, quizzes (STAD evaluation), and multiple intelligence. Fourth, the task division multiple intelligence theory was applied to cooperative learning (Jigsaw) model, because the purpose is to study the in-depth knowledge of a student's appropriate effectiveness for elementary school or of high school students in order to apply their knowledge in subjects, such as language, math, social studies, and science. As of now, one example of using the MI theory of cooperative learning is sharing tasks. The teacher should describe the reconfigured abilities like the aptitude of students, levels, characteristics of each subject, and the classroom environment and conditions while taking into account the reconfigured abilities. },

The major aim of this research study is to design a 'Student Model' on the basis of the individual's 'bio-psychological potential'. In this work, the student's cognitive and personality traits are identified through psychometric inventories such as Benziger thinking style assessment (BTSA) for brain dominance analysis, Kolb's learning style inventory (LSI) for identifying the style of learning, Howard Gardner's MI inventory for multiple intelligence identification and Paul Costa R. Robert McCrae's Big Five personality identification. The proposed model using a fuzzy soft set-based hybrid optimization algorithm for reducing the parameters. The fuzzy softest phase follows fuzzification in which the linguistic variables are formed from the crisp input and generate fuzzy sets further fuzzy soft sets are formed from the formulated fuzzy sets. Finally, the hybrid fuzzy particle swarm-grey wolf optimizer (HFPSGWO) algorithm to accomplish parameter reduction and determine the indispensable parameters and final phase perform student rank analysis. The performance results reveal that the hybrid fuzzy GWO (FGWO) and fuzzy PSO (FPSO)are outperformed when analysing different performances such as fitness function, selection of features, accuracy, and computational time. },

In this paper, we argue that we should overcome our anthropocentrism and appreciate the wonders of intelligence in nonhuman and nonbiological animals instead. For that reason, we study two cases of octopus intelligence and intelligence in machine learning systems to embrace the notion of intelligence as a non-unitary faculty with pluralistic forms. Furthermore, we derive lessons for advancing our human self-understanding. },

  abstract={ Rev. Yonggi Cho is one of the most famous pastors and preachersin the contemporary Korean church history. He has conveyed not only victorious Jesus but also awaked and vitalized the churches in Korea and over the world by his preaching and marvelous works through the Holy Spirit. At first, he planted a church in the poverty sticken area, the outskirts of Seoul, with five members and later became the senior pastor of the biggest church in the world, Yoido Full Gospel Church, through his strong leadership based on the church growth and powerful hope-and-blessing-based preaching. The church became the epitome of the Korean church growth in history and he became one of the influential preachers in the contemporary Korean church. His preaching was formed through his specific testimonies from experience and his innovative narrative such as Threefold Blessing and Fivefold Gospel. It was formed through his crisis experience that he was healed and showed the important reality of faith in his ministry and preaching. This article focuses on evaluating Rev. Cho’s preaching ministry from the narrative perspective of innovativeness suggested by Howard Gardner and proposing the implication for his followers in the future through ministries by Johann Christoph Blumhardt and his son, Christoph Blumhardt, German pastors in the 19th and 20th centuries. },

A mixed method was chosen for this purpose, and quantitative and qualitative research analysis was comprehensively interpreted to draw conclusions as follows. First, Arts PROPEL consisting of various musical activities in the areas of singing, playing instrument, listening, and creating music for 3rd graders in middle school considering the curriculum in national level was developed through the processes of domain projects focusing on production, perception, and reflection. Second, it was verified that Arts PROPEL music program had significant differences between the experiment group and the control group for improving self-efficacy and music cognition ability. Third, as a result of the analysis of the participatory observing note, interview materials, and process-folio based on the evaluation criteria and rubric, the students improved their participation in music learning and increased their interest in music as they communicated among the members and planned how to study. Through this study, it was confirmed that there would be positive possibilities of Arts PROPEL in regular music curriculum in Korea, and that there were differences of developing talents of students depending on learning methods. It is expected that the study will be effective method for students' musical development, and furthermore, it is hoped that long-term and practical studies will continue. },

The emergence of the MI theory and the three-ring model renders us to depict giftedness from a different perspective. Renzulli’s three-ring model is argued to be well motivated, constituting a foundational basis for defining general giftedness. In this paper, the three-ring model is argued to become a solid basis for defining verbal giftedness with some additional idiosyncratic criteria. Identification of verbal giftedness is closely linked to the definition of verbal giftedness. It is shown to be made largely by combining psychometric procedures, achievement, and teacher recommendation. },

  abstract={ A Sociology Approach: Dance can be a useful tool for teaching students about culture and community. Through the language of Dance and Music (Caribbean Dance), context is given to social facts, which engages and informs students about such social issues as history, Colonialism, social class, gender, race/ethnicity, and social justice. The added bonus of using Dance as a lens is that it involves active, embodied learning (Dewey, English, Mead), making the material more memorable, meaningful, and relevant to the learner.A Communicative Approach (Task-based Learning Activity) & Language for Specific Purposes: Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) is a derivative of the Communicative Approach (CA) and Second language Acquisition (SLA) studies. Certain types of communicative learning activities can lead to acquisition of language (Abdel Kazeroni, Aquilino Sanchez, Margaret Robertson, Yiqng Lin). When teaching a Hispanic Dance Session using specific Spanish vocabulary of the dance to address certain dance movements (like Flamenco dance), we engage language learners in acquiring Spanish parts of language related to the flamenco dance. We also immerse learners in the culture of flamenco dance, and its rich cultural context, so they can learn about the social context, gender issues, the different meanings of the dance movements, the metaphors, and by extension they will learn about diversity, tolerance, inclusion, and respect for another culture through dance and music (Language for Specific Purposes: Angela N. Gardner, Howard Gardner, Victoria Escaip). },

As a result, linguistic intelligence questions regarding writing, listening, speaking and vocabulary acquisition were selected. logical-mathematical intelligence questions regarding strategy, counting, patterns, hypothesis, verification, and comparing, contrasting, calculating ability were selected. Spatial intelligence questions regarding drawing, coloring, representation activities, operating and creating were selected, physical performance intelligence questions regarding global muscles, eye-hand coordination, flexibility, accommodation force, balance, agility and muscular strength were selected. Musical intelligence included questions about singing, and playing musical instruments. Interpersonal intelligence included perspective-taking, role-sharing, cooperation and discussion. For intrapersonal intelligence questions regarding personal significance-ties, planning-decision making, emotional expression and problem solving were selected. Finally, in relation to naturalist intelligence, questions regarding living organisms, inanimate objects and seasons were selected. In addition, traditional games were analyzed based on the finalized guidelines, and the results showed that each of the traditional games would not only work with one intelligence at a time but with other different intelligence as well. In the light of that, the study confirmed the validity of the guidelines on how to select traditional games that would develop multiple intelligences in children. },

  abstract={ Despite evidence from cognitive psychology that men and women are equal in measured intelligence, gender differences in self-estimated intelligence (SEI) are widely reported with males providing systematically higher estimates than females. This has been termed the male hubris, female humility effect. The present study explored personality factors that might explain this. Participants (N = 228; 103 male, 125 female) provided self-estimates of their general IQ and for Gardner's multiple intelligences, before completing the Cattell Culture Fair IQ test as an objective measure of intelligence. They also completed the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) as a measure of sex-role identification, and measures of general and academic self-esteem. Both gender and sex-role differences were observed for SEI, with males and participants of both genders who scored high in masculinity offering higher self-estimates. By comparing estimated and observed IQ, we were able to rule out gender differences in overall accuracy but observed a pattern of systematic underestimation in females. An hierarchical multiple regression showed significant independent effects of gender, masculinity, and self-esteem. Mixed evidence was observed for gender differences in the estimation of multiple intelligences, though moderately sized sex-role differences were observed. The results offer a far more nuanced explanation for the male hubris, female humility effect that includes the contribution of sex role identification to individual and group differences. },

The fact that we have different cognitive capabilities compels us to consider them in educational proposals and to develop them in students respecting their individual differences. The present study analyses the intellectual profile of secondary school students and the contexts that promote different cognitive capabilities. The research study is divided into two phases. The first phase seeks to show the diversity of intelligences that coexists in a particular group of secondary school students and their specific talents. The second phase has the purpose of revealing which contexts allow the development and expression of the potential of talented students. The results indicate that each student exhibits a unique intellectual profile. Furthermore, it was found that some extracurricular contexts and environments can act as catalysts for the development of cognitive, artistic and social abilities. },

  abstract={ Often one hears that leaders lead through action, by example. But more often, and often more effectively, leaders lead through their words, by acts of speech, as it were. They are frequently called upon to speak and write, formally and informally, to convey their vision for their organization to their staff and constituents. In doing so, they are not only announcing that vision, but are engaging in a rhetorical negotiation with their audience, trying out words, phrases, and literary constructions to better and more convincingly communicate their vision of their organization and the direction in which they wish to take it. If their rhetoric fails, or is not wholly successful, they strive to change or modify it. Through such verbal exchanges, leaders communicate the style and substance of their leadership and give form and imaginative life to their vision for the organization. Howard Gardner (1995), the Harvard psychologist, has written that '[L]eaders achieve their effectiveness chiefly through the stories they relate'. He calls these stories 'stories of identity', narratives 'that help individuals think about and feel who they are, where they come from, and where they are headed' and that such stories 'constitute the single most powerful weapon in the leader's literary arsenal'. This essay recounts, as a case study, the role of such stories in the turnaround of an organization, the Harvard University Art Museums, and reflects generally on the role of rhetoric in leadership. },

To this end, experience activities corresponding to the 'world of technology' units in 5th-grade Practical Arts textbooks were analyzed based on multiple intelligence utilization teaching methods. According to the results of the analysis of the field of experience activities, the ratio was 27.9 percent for linguistic intelligence, 24.8 percent for intrapersonal intelligence, 14.9 percent for naturalistic intelligence, 13.1 percent for spatial intelligence, 6.8 percent for logical-mathematical intelligence and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, and 5.6 percent for interpersonal intelligence. All areas of multiple intelligences were being used evenly in general, except for musical intelligence.An analysis of the type of learning activity showed that ‘investigate and write reports’ related to linguistic intelligence accounted for the largest portion with 23. It was found that all six textbooks utilized almost all types of multiple intelligences learning activities, comparing the number of activities presented as hands-on activities in textbooks and the number of types of learning activities by multi-intelligence area used.As the result of this study is an analysis of the “world of technology” in the fifth grade of elementary school, there are limitations in generalizing the whole textbook. },

  abstract={ Bodies have been used as a political tool in activism, but many scholars have ignored activists' highly sophisticated and intelligent ways of using their moving bodies. This paper focuses on analysing three choreographies of resistance: the group crawling performance for striking nurses in Helsinki in 2007, the protest by Greenpeace at a nuclear construction site in 2007 and a protest in the 1989 Chinese student movement. The purpose is to shed light on how resisting choreographies can generate interactions and relations between agents keeping these interactions dynamic by the motivations and affections of these agents. I will apply Edmund Husserl's and Edith Stein's phenomenological method of analysing movement and their notion of kinaesthesia. One of the keywords here is 'the kinaesthetic field' that offers a new perspective to account for resisting choreography and its dynamics in socially, politically and emotionally complex environments. Drawing on Howard Gardner's notion of kinaesthetic intelligence, I suggest that the core element of kinaesthetic intelligence is not only control of one's bodily motion but also capabilities for working with kinaesthetic fields. The paper argues that the activists can operate gestures, the vulnerability of the body and timing by drawing various agents into their choreography. When activists are able to express their political ideas as concrete gestures, postures or kinaesthetic relations, it also supports their capabilities of articulating their moral intuitions. Even when witnesses disagree with protesters' positions, protests frequently force them to reconsider their own. },

  abstract={ In the multiple intelligence framework, newer and more contextualized cognitive tasks are suggested as alternative to more traditional psychometric tests. The purpose of this article is to examine whether or not these two types of instruments converge into a general factor of cognitive performance. Thus, the Battery of General and Differential Aptitudes (BADyG: reasoning, memory, verbal aptitude, numerical aptitude and spatial aptitude) and a set of Gardner's multiple intelligence assessment tasks (linguistic, logical, visual/spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, naturalistic and musical intelligences) were administered to 294 children aged 5 to 7. The confirmatory factor analysis points out the absence of a common general factor considering both batteries, indicating instead the existence of two general factors, which gather the tests that encompass them. Also, these two general factors correspond to traditional and multiple intelligence assessments and show a statistically moderate correlation between them. These results challenge Gardner's original position on refusing a general factor of intelligence, especially when considering the cognitive dimensions measured which do not coincide with the more traditional tests of intelligence.

  abstract={ Since the Gifted Education Promotion Law was proclaimed in 2001, gifted education has become a catchword among educators and school practitioners. Accordingly, math and science have been selected as two core curricula areas for gifted education. Compared to these core areas, languageespecially Englishfails to be valued as much. I attribute this to the following two facts. First, the government views verbal giftedness as less contributing to the country’s technological development than the two other areas. Second, it is also attributable to the general belief of educators and school practitioners that language is rarely endemic to giftedness. With respect to institutions for the gifted, there are three representative institutions for gifted education: gifted schools, gifted centers, and gifted classes. Verbally gifted education is, however, offered at the latter two types of institutions. This paper argues that verbally gifted education should be offered mainly in gifted classes for the following two reasons. First, it might be easier to implement regular and continuous language instruction in school classes, enabling more effective language acquisition. Second, offering regular gifted classes during school hours ensures that identified gifted students take only those classes, not both ordinary and gifted ones, consequently challenging the gifted's interest and level of ability. },

The aim of rehabilitation is to promote the harmonious development of the individual through collaboration between medical and educational sciences, involved in the educability of the whole person, in which the aim is not only functional recovery but also social-reintegration.This functional synergy permits the development of the person, and establishes an indissoluble link between functions and attitudes, thus allowing the achievement of the greater possible autonomy. In this way classical and pedagogical rehabilitation may be combined in a single concept of educational action. To realize this integrated educational process it is important to evaluate and promote awareness development, based on the possibilities of brain plasticity and on the presence of multiple intelligences skillfully intertwined each other. Therefore, self-awareness plays a prime role in educational actions for the rehabilitation of persons with severe ABI. },

The results showed that the prevalence of exceptionally gifted individuals in residential childcare facility is at least as high as in the intact population. However, we observed characteristics typical for dual exceptionality among all research participants. In the discussion, we outline the possibilities of adapting the conditions in the residential childcare setting, emphasizing the need for quality diagnostics.

Recently the Republic of Korea tries to transform to the country’s post catchup economic growth in order to join the ranks of advanced countries, and people actively plan and conduct varied business to develop creative and capable people for the future. Creative talent no longer means a person with a clever brain but a novel idea who is capable of harmonizing left and right side brains. Creativity as a result of the human brain activity, it can be activated and promoted by training between 3 to 11 years old when human being’s cognitive ability, thinking and judgement begin to form. In this context, promotion of creativity in education is not one-sided education, it is organically structured interactive education that emphasize and advance children’s basic fundamentals. To children, it is difficult to come up with new things by a lack of experience in external stimulation. The creative ability to the young children is the ability to stretch new and exuberant imagination based on their experiences from many stimuli. Considering what mentioned above, this research suggests the model of creative thinking model based on imagination targeting children from three to eleven years old with the study into Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligence and creative pedagogy. The creative thinking program based on imagination is composed of three categories; linguistic and visual/spatial information linking, logical/mathematical and visual/spatial information linking, and musical and visual/spatial information linking. For sustainable and rich growth of this program, the system to run the program is designed inviting varied professionals’ participation. },

For this purpose, two hundred fifty-two pre-service teachers from K University in D city were recruited. The survey instrument used for this study was developed by the research based on Yang’s(2006) and Shim’s(2003). This instrument consists of five categories: ① contents reflecting ‘the needs of social life’, ② contents reflecting ‘the needs of future society’, ③ contents reflecting ‘various teaching-learning activities’, ④ contents reflecting ‘the theory of multiple intelligences’, ⑤ contents reflecting ‘multicultural understanding’. This instrument contains total forty-nine questions. And each question asks about the importance as educational contents and the degree of implementing (performance) in high school curriculum of specific contents. The results of this study are summarized as follows: First, pre-service teachers report high importance and low performance on the category of “the needs of social life”. Second, in the category of ‘the needs of social life’, the contents about ‘economic education and consumer education’, ‘the life style that doing one’s best’ and ‘understanding about various life styles’ take quadrant Ⅱ of high importance and low performance. In the category of ‘various teaching-learning activities’, the contents for ‘developing creativity’ takes quadrant Ⅱ of high importance and low performance. In the category of ‘the theory of multiple intelligences’, the contents for ‘interpersonal intelligence’ and ‘interpersonal intelligence’ take quadrant Ⅱ of high importance and low performance. Lastly, in the category of ‘multicultural understanding’, the contents about ‘the embracement of various social class and ethnic groups’ takes quadrant Ⅱ of high importance and low performance. Through analyzing learners’ as education comsumers recognitions of null curriculum, this study can provide valuable and significant informations to curriculum construction field. },

The sample consisted of 95 university professors from a private university in Arequipa. The results indicate that teachers have predominantly metacognitive strategies that are located at a high level of development, whereas the multiple intelligences with higher mean were Linguistic-verbal, Interpersonal and Intrapersonal. Differences were also recorded for length of service and marital status, as well as relationships between metacognitive strategies and verbal Linguistic Intelligence. A regression analysis was also performed which indicated that verbal Linguistic Intelligence has an impact on metacognitive strategies, which prove the relevance of Vygotsky’s theory. },

Methods: A cross-sectional study design using convenience sampling was conducted among 200 community-dwelling participants aged 65 years or older. Results: The Rasch analyses showed that the MIS had good structure validity and unidimensionality. Among various CFA models testing the MIS factor structure, exploratory structural equation modelling performed the best given its parsimonious and excellent fit indices. Conclusions: The MIS can be used among older adults in a culturally-fair way for understanding their multiple intelligences. Using the MIS, healthcare providers could encourage older people to assess their own strengths and weaknesses of intelligence. The results suggest that more research on older adults' MI is needed to tailor bespoke therapeutic programs to individual needs in community settings. },

In EDUCE, the pedagogical framework classifies the educational content and the learner characteristics in the student model along two dimensions: Gardner's Multiple Intelligences and Bloom's learning goals. The two dimensions represent the philosophical underpinning in the design of instructional strategies and for understanding the student behaviour. It is through the provision of a variety of instructional strategies, that EDUCE aims to motivate and engage the learner. This paper describes the principles, architecture, design and implementation of EDUCE. It shows how educational theory may underpin the design of an ITS and how a pedagogical component that accommodates learning characteristics may be incorporated into an ITS. It also shows how to develop a mechanism by which the learner can choose between alternative instructional approaches. },

Result: While case studies demonstrated that successful implementation improves academic performance, motivation, and engagement, especially in foreign language teaching, the analysis showed that differentiation is typically framed through student-focused or teaching methods, underscoring the need for system-oriented research. Conclusion: In order to address the varying needs of students, foster inclusion, and improve academic performance, differentiation in education is crucial. To develop supportive learning environments that play to each student's individual strengths, it takes system-wide research, teacher training, and resources. },

It can dynamically identify learning characteristics and adaptively provide a customised learning material tailored to the learner. This paper describes a research study using EDUCE that examines the relationship between the adaptive presentation strategy, the level of choice available and the learning performance of science school students aged 12 to 14. The paper presents some preliminary results from a group of 18 students that have participated in the study so far. Results suggest that learning strategies that encourage the student to use as many resources as possible are the most effective. They suggest that learning gain can improve by presenting students initially with learning resources that are not usually used and subsequently providing a range of resources from which students may choose. },

The features of the theory of cognitive psychology, namely: the multpk intelligence of Howard Gardner, who identified eight basic types of intelligence (linguistic, interpersonal, eNistential, naturalistic, muskeg bodily-kinaesthetic, visual-spatial, logical-mathematical), are highlighted.In a theoretical study, we hate analysed the general meaning of the concept of intelligence from the point of view of cognitive psychology, and we specified it by outlining the main characteristics of multiple intelligence. We also conducted an analysis of the scienqic works of specialists specializing in working with models of cognitite-speech activity and investigated the linguistic mind in preschool children. Not only a certain type of intellect is considered, but also all the others that were named by Gardner, their main aspects of influence on a personality are revealed, they appear even in preschool age.In the empirical part of the study, methods were used to diagnose the verbal level of intelligence of the basic element of cognitive abilities in preschool children. They are aimed at researching the ability to generalize and analyse verbal information, identifying the ability to classify objects according to common features, differentiate emotional states in the process of communication, and also establish the level of vocabulary of preschoolers. According to these indicators, 90 preschoolers were diagnosed, and their level of verbal intelligence was revealed.The paper identifies the main features, skills that a child possesses with a high average or low level of intelligence, correction methods, in order to improve low results. },

  abstract={ The aim of this study is to gather evidence that the existing emotional and multiple intelligence scales measure self-assessment and so self-esteem rather than intelligence, based on the inappropriateness of item-response structures of these scales. For this purpose, relationships among the emotional intelligence, the multiple intelligence, and the self-esteem scales and factor structures of the scales were investigated. Data were collected from 246 individuals over 18 years of age in using the snowball sampling method, through face-to-face communication or reaching out to the researchers' acquaintances via the internet due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) revealed that the emotional intelligence, the multiple intelligence, and the self-esteem scales indicated one dominant factor, although these scales were presented as more than one factor in literature. The single-factor structure in double, triple, and all scale combinations was investigated through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). So, it was found that the single factor structure indicates a good or acceptable fit for all the combinations. In addition, with the help of One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), it was revealed that scores obtained from the emotional or the multiple scales increase as self-liking level increases. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the emotional and the multiple intelligence scales mainly measure self-liking (self-esteem) levels due to item-response styles of the scales as self-evaluation. },

  abstract={ Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) is a process for learning life skills, such as one's view on oneself and relationship with others. In dealing with oneself, SEL helps us recognize our emotions and manage those feelings. In dealing with other people, SEL helps us develop our empathy for others, and maintain positive relationships. SEL also focuses on dealing with various situations in a constructive and ethical manner. The social and emotional competencies (Self-Awareness, Social Awareness, Self-Management, Relationship Skills, Responsible Decision Making) help to prevent the violence in school as well as they promote the academic achievements of the students. In the area of educational psychology the works of Howard Gardner (Frames of Mind, 1983) and Daniel Goleman (Emotional Intelligence, 1995) have influenced the development of SEL in its theory. In recent decades, SEL has been developed in hundreds of models which take use of SEL in their concrete situations. Among them the most successful examples can be said to be “Resolving Conflict Creatively Program” and the “New Haven Social Development Program.” Both cases show that SEL have achieved successful cases to make a peaceable(peaceful) classroom, and the most effective manuals to prevent violences in school. Furthermore, a series of curriculum has been set up for the long term peace education.If we want to adapt the SEL to the Korean context we should be careful about this: SEL is cannot be misunderstood as a mere emotional skill just for the better academic achievement nor misused as a implicit tactics for controlling the minds of people in capitalistic purpose. SEL is not designed to completely replace the entire system of peace education, but to compensate for the wholeness of that, producing the practical fields and opportunities in which students learn the values of peace in dynamic interactions. },

  abstract={ In the 21st century, educators seem to have more capacity for thinking pluralistically about teaching than they did a few decades ago. It is now commonplace to talk about multiple intelligences, a variety of teaching and learning styles, different acceptable outcomes of education. If we take the lead from archetypal psychology, the Greek pantheon can provide us with language for talking about a wide range of distinct philosophies, value systems, energies, feeling states, habits of behavior and teaching styles as they can be observed in the classroom. The gods are many, and if we follow the advice of the ancient Greeks we will be careful not to neglect any of themand not get too carried away in worshiping any single one of them. },

  abstract={ In many developed cultures there is an assumption that IQ is intelligence. However, emerging theories of multiple intelligences, of emotional intelligence, as well as the application of IQ testing to other cultural groups, and to people with disability, raises many questions as to what IQ actually measures. Despite recent research that shows IQ testing produces a floor effect when applied to people with lower IQ, as well as research that shows the Flynn effect also applies to people with lower IQ, in practice IQ scores below a certain cut-off are still being used to determine and classify a person's intellectual disability. However, a new paradigm is emerging, almost returning to the original intent of Binet, where measurement is made of the supports the person needs. In this paper, we argue that if one extends the notions of this supports paradigm that diagnosis of intellectual or physical disability could potentially be replaced by diagnosis of additional intellectual support needs, or additional physical support needs. },

  abstract={ Nurses are being increasingly asked to develop leadership skills in their practice and to be actively involved in continuous change processes in the workplace. Nursing students need to be developing leadership skills prior to entering the workplace to ensure they are able to meet the challenges associated with organisations and the cultures present in nursing, along with having highly tuned communication skills and leadership attributes that contribute to best patient care and outcomes. This paper looks at how the use of Active Learning in an undergraduate setting enabled the development and implementation of a leadership subject for nursing students preparing for professional practice. Through the use of a specific model of Active Learning, incorporating multiple intelligences into education allows students to bring deeper learning to their conscience so that whole person learning is an engaged experience. It seems apparent that Active Learning is an effective means of learning about leadership in undergraduate students who are developing towards a career as a health professional.

We tested this hypothesis with multisource data, including multiple intelligences, in a sample of 126 Swiss military officers with both domestic and cross-border leadership responsibilities. Results supported our predictions: (1) general intelligence predicted both domestic and cross-border leadership effectiveness; (2) emotional intelligence was a stronger predictor of domestic leadership effectiveness, and (3) cultural intelligence was a stronger predictor of cross-border leadership effectiveness. Overall, results show the value of cultural intelligence as a critical leadership competency in today's globalized world. },

In this study, the writers analyze the relationship between El and leadership behaviors, specifically examining the relationship between El and transformational leadership behaviors. The paper outlines the strengths and weaknesses found in executives in relation to developing transformational leadership behaviors. Through the use of established testing procedures, the researchers identify five specific components of El that are related to transformational leadership behavior at a convincing level of statistical significance. Of particular importance is the identification of interpersonal skills and empathy as key El behaviors that need additional attention during the development of construction industry executives. The writers contend that these traits are as important as classical traits of intelligence and experience in developing the leaders of tomorrow's construction organizations. },

The present study employed a different concept of ability, namely, Fleishman's (1975) structure of human performance, to investigate the psychometric structure of self-estimates. A structural equation model generally confirmed Fleishman's apriori taxonomy. In addition, the structure of self-estimated abilities closely resembled models of measured cognitive ability (e. g., Carroll, 1993) and one latent trait, termed general factor, was identified. Modest sex differences in self-estimated ability were confirmed in favor of men; however, the latter were noteworthy only for the domains of spatial orientation and physical strengths. Implications for research and practice are discussed. },

To accomplish this purpose, 12 textbooks of middle school 「Technology･Home economics」 textbooks were titled Nutrition and Dietary Behavior of Adolescents, Planning and Choosing Meals, Choosing Foods and Safe Cooking except the questions, the tasks that the students can perform are analyzed based on the teaching and learning methods using multiple intelligences. Analysis methods were analyzed by using contents analysis method, focusing on learning activities, and sub-questions of activities were all included in each activity, and the process of preparing activities on a continuous line was grouped into one. Three people analyzed the activities and proceeded to revise and supplement the analysis standard through consultation. The other three researchers confirmed it. As a result of analyzing 12 kinds of textbooks, the number of activity tasks was 25~74 for each kind of textbooks, and the total number of activities was 527. According to the ratio of multiple intelligences, 35% of the tasks were using logical-mathematical intelligence, and 26.8% of linguistic intelligence, 23% of intrapersonal intelligence, 7.2% of interpersonal intelligence, 3.8% of spatial intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic(2.7%) and musical intelligence(1.5%). On the other hand, it was analyzed that there is no activity task using naturalist intelligence. Except to the naturalist intelligence, general intelligence was utilized. This indicates that the home economics curriculum is a convergence of the home economics curriculum in that it is a reorganization by extracting the contents and methods of other curriculum related to dietary life, is interpreted. This study is expected to provide a framework for various teaching and learning methods to activate students' participation classes and to provide an alternative to realize convergence education in home economics curriculum. },

The findings indicate the ratio of art-related content is comparatively high in the Pleasant Life curriculum. In particular, modeling element takes a large proportion out of musical, physical, and art-related elements. The textbook includes monotonous and repetitive examples of students' activities and some of them are less appropriate for elementary students. As a result, this study suggests the textbook should deal with various examples to enable students to use their multiple intelligences and curriculum should consider students' level of understanding and knowledge background. },

First, from a conceptual 'enactive' perspective, our REMIND method seeks to understand more clearly visitors' sense-making processes. This involves employing an eye-tracker video recording of visitors' gaze points as the basis of semi-guided interviews conducted on the site of the museum immediately after the visit. Second, our EMOTION method traces visitors' paths in the museum linked to their declared level of emotions. In doing this, the method creates an emotion-map of a visitor's journey in the museum. The two methods identify museum features conducive to sensemaking, which can be linked to Gardner's (1993) multiple intelligences, and to disengaging 'sense-wrecking'. },

The college admissions system may produce confusion in Taiwan. Schools in metropolitan areas retain an advantage for screening talent across multiple abilities, and colleges in agricultural counties may unintentionally marginalize people, resulting in insufficient enrollment or an inverse selection of talent. It has been suggested that increasing the number of schools in metropolitan areas will reduce the rates of enrollment failure and improve the compulsory education environment that many are forced to attend. },

  abstract={ This research draws upon the increasing usage of Al in service. It aims at understanding the extent to which Al systems have multiple intelligence types like humans and if these types arouse different emotions in consumers. To this end, the research uses a two-study approach: Study I builds and evaluates a scale for measuring different Al intelligence types. Study 2 evaluates consumers' emotional responses to the different Al intelligences. The findings provide a measurement scale for evaluating different types of artificial intelligence against human ones, thus showing that artificial intelligences are configurable, describable, and measurable (Study I ), and influence positive and negative consumers' emotions (Study 2). The findings also demonstrate that consumers display different emotions, in terms of happiness, excitement, enthusiasm, pride, inspiration, sadness, fear, anger, shame, and anxiety, and also emotional attachment, satisfaction, and usage intention when interacting with the different types of Al intelligences. Our scale builds upon human intelligence against Al intelligence characteristics while providing a guidance for future development of Al-based systems more similar to human intelligences. },

  abstract={ In the current teaching of politics, teachers still focus on the cultivation of the basic intelligence of students' language intelligence, and it is easy to ignore the cultivation of other intelligences that affect the overall development of students. This research mainly discusses the design of curriculum ideological and political teaching platform based on the fusion of multiple data and information in an intelligent environment. This research adopts the MVC architecture, and the web application developed based on the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture pattern is easier to complete the realization of multiple controllers. The front desk ideological and political teaching teacher module includes the login system. In addition, the teacher can view the test status of a specific student and can also pay attention to the total intelligence of all students who have been tested. The process of the student test is to enter the correct account and password to log in to the system and then perform the test. After the test, the test result can be viewed, and the personal information can be maintained at the same time. In addition, the personal login password can be modified. The existence of the database is to ensure that the data is correct and effective. This system uses MySql to design the database, and the name of the database is braintest_db. The data table in relational database is the main object of storing and managing data, and it is also an important task of database design. This system has designed three kinds of user logins, namely, administrator, student, and teacher, and login can be realized according to the account number and password. Among them, teacher's participation is by inquiring about students' test situation, paying attention to students' multiple intelligences, and teaching students in accordance with their aptitude. In addition, the main object of this test is students, and the analysis of multiple intelligences is realized through student tests. Students are vitally physical objects that can be tested and searched for results. In the study, 20% of the students both learn the basic content of the platform and use the forum. This research will help improve students' literacy in an all-round way. },

  abstract={ Background: Many popular educational programmes claim to be 'brain-based', despite pleas from the neuroscience community that these neuromyths do not have a basis in scientific evidence about the brain.Purpose: The main aim of this paper is to examine several of the most popular neuromyths in the light of the relevant neuroscientific and educational evidence. Examples of neuromyths include: 10% brain usage, left- and right-brained thinking, VAK learning styles and multiple intelligencesSources of eividence: The basis for the argument put forward includes a literature review of relevant cognitive neuroscientific studies, often involving neuroimaging, together with several comprehensive education reviews of the brain-based approaches under scrutiny.Main argument: The main elements of the argument are as follows. We use most of our brains most of the time, not some restricted 10% brain usage. This is because our brains are densely interconnected, and we exploit this interconnectivity to enable our primitively evolved primate brains to live in our complex modern human world. Although brain imaging delineates areas of higher (and lower) activation in response to particular tasks, thinking involves coordinated interconnectivity from both sides of the brain, not separate left- and right-brained thinking. High intelligence requires higher levels of inter-hemispheric and other connected activity. The brain's interconnectivity includes the senses, especially vision and hearing. We do not learn by one sense alone, hence VAK learning styles do not reflect bow our brains actually learn, nor the individual differences we observe in classrooms. Neuroimaging studies do not support multiple intelligences; in fact, the opposite is true. Through the activity of its frontal cortices, among other areas, the human brain seems to operate with general intelligence, applied to multiple areas of endeavour. Studies of educational effectiveness of applying any of these ideas in the classroom have failed to find any educational benefits.Conclusions: The main conclusions arising from the argument are that teachers should seek independent scientific validation before adopting brain-based products in their classrooms. A more sceptical approach to educational panaceas could contribute to an enhanced professionalism of the field. },

  volume={ 30 },

  issn={ 1229-3202 },
  abstract={ We currently witness an increase in the currency of educational phrases involving ‘competence’, which translates into requests for curriculum reform suitable for our next generation. As is often noted, such requests in fact emphasize non-cognitive competences such as social skills, personal attitudes and ethical behaviors as the essential contents of our new curriculum. In spite of the currently high volume of scholarly works on competence-based curriculum reform that usually stresses learning and teaching of non-cognitive competences, however, it is not clear what the relationship we can draw between cognitive and non-cognitive competences. As the relation between the two can clarify the specific strategies of reforming the current curriculum, it is crucial for us to examine the types of such relations. Certain philosophical traditions have advocated a positive relation between the two, whereas certain cognitive psychological theories have it denied. And a recent comparative international survey shows that the case is more complicated than such an advocacy-denial dichotomy and that the relation could be diversely set up based upon cultural and social contexts. Thus, competence-based curriculum reform requires further analyses of the relations between cognitive and non-cognitive competences in each subject matter, which have been specifically formed in our cultural and social context. },

The main focus is on auto-evaluation as a means of beginning class in an organized and motivating way. In contrast to 'bell work' or other start-of-period activities on random topics, auto-evaluation involves asking questions that are closely tied to what is being studied in class. Every day, students answer questions, discuss, and evaluate their responses, and record their mark on a marking grid. An example of the grid is provided along with sample questions related to Grade 9 core French. These questions illustrate how one can take into consideration students' 'multiple intelligences,' as well as their needs and interests. In addition to daily auto-evaluation, other ideas are presented on incorporating self-assessment into one's classes. },

  abstract={ Research on learning has shown that students learn differently and that they process knowledge in various ways. EDUCE is an Intelligent Tutoring System for which a set of learning resources has been developed using the principles of Multiple Intelligences. It can dynamically identify user learning characteristics and adaptively provide a customised learning material tailored to the learner. This paper introduces the predictive engine used within EDUCE. It describes the input representation model and the learning mechanism employed. The input representation model consists of input features that describe how different resources were used and inferred from fine-grained information collected during student computer interactions. The predictive engine employs the Naive Bayes classifier and operates online using no prior information. Using data from a previous experimental study, a comparison was made between the performance of the predictive engine and the actual behaviour of a group of students using the learning material without any guidance from EDUCE. Results indicate correlation between student's behaviour and the predictions made by EDUCE. These results suggest that the concept of learning characteristics can be modelled using a learning scheme with appropriately chosen attributes. },

Differentiated instruction enhances learning for all learners by engaging them in activities that better respond to their particular learning needs, multiple intelligences, emotions, prior experience, interests, attitudes etc.Teachers can facilitate learning using the adjustable assignments based on the individual differences. Also teachers can group the learners flexibly using TAPS(total, alone, pairs, small group). For the differentiated instructional strategies of the creative experiential activities, it is needed that various instructional strategies such as learning center, project, problem-based learning, learning contract, role play etc should be applied. },

And the result is as following.First, there is correlation between the theory of multiple intelligence and the theory of Motif and we would able to educate students by departmentalizing the multiple intelligence with various methods and shapes.Second, there is very close correlation between the theory of emotional quotient and the theory of Motif, so it would be helpful to develop programs which is connecting both two theories.Third, there is also very close correlation between the theory of network quotient and the theory of Motif, and this theoretical basement adds the value of the theory of Motif.Fourth, The theory of Motif, which has all the elements of the theory of multiple intelligence, emotional quotient, and network quotient, can be a good device for discovering talents by educating it.This result suggests theoretical basement that the education of Motif, based on the theory of multiple intelligence, emotional quotient, and network quotient, is very valuable. As the creative education appeals today, the education of creative movement with Motif is expected to receive good response as a new education method. Therefore, on the base of this theory, it would be helpful to develop programs and evaluate them and in addition, I hope various creative teaching would be distributed with more active response and open view. },

  abstract={ This study builds on a direction of the missiological spirituality of Christianity in multicultural society. Currently, multiculturalization is a noticeable change of the globalized world. Specifically, Korean society recently experiences such a change. As Christianity has been dynamically transformed to adjust culture change, or context change, for the missiological purpose, Korean Christianity demands a new perspective that can be adapt to the today’s context change. This study is focusing on the contextual need.By employing the biblical and theological discussion, the writer illuminates Christian basic idea from the perspective of relationship-based spirituality. Simply, Christianity is basically relationship-based. From the creation story, God the Father was co-working with the Son and the Spirit in the nature of the Trinity. In the greatest commandment, the Son is inviting all creature into God’s such a relational friendship. (Mt. 22:37-40) This belief was inherited to the disciples just as the benediction of Paul in 2Corinthians (13:14) presents that blessings are derived from the Trinity of the relational God. Furthermore, Jesus extends the concept of relational friendship, not only close neighbors but also far-off neighbors, that is, not only the members of family and church community, but also strangers and even enemies. Such a Biblical principle currently directs the Christian perspective to reach to all the neighbors, people from different cultures, with the love of Christ, called relationship-based spirituality.In order to investigate effective methods, this writing suggests six main theoretical models. As for the concept of intercultural perspective, the writer brings the notion of Klaus Issler, which can be called the extension of neighbor concept. And for the ideas of cultural diverse and individuals’ transformation, this study employs following models, like experiential transformation (David Kolb), hidden curriculum (Judith and Sherwood Lingenfelter), ecology system (Urie Bronfenbrenner), multiple intelligence (Howard Gardner), storytelling (Tom Steffen). Thus, the concept of intercultural transformation can be conceptualized as the relationship-based love of Christians toward all the people from diverse cultures. },

  abstract={ To elucidate the reflection of the effect of Western drawing techniques introduce into Japan and Korea in the modern era in contemporary primary school art textbooks, the present study examined the contents of these textbooks, with a focus on perspective representation. With its basis established through research by painters and sculptors during the Renaissance, perspective representation was introduced in earnest into art textbooks compiled following the consolidation of the framework of the modern school system. Perspective representation in “primary school”art textbooks was addressed the most as a means of teaching sketches,where surrounding objects or natural landscapes are depicted on the canvas. Normal School Drawing Book introduced sketch education in earnest into primary education, and this brought about a transition to modern art education from reproduction-centered art education. In addition, perspective representation was addressed the most in the areas of ideational paintings and sketches. In the case of sketches, the most frequent subject matters were natural landscapes, followed by architectural structures and indoor scenes, in this order. As for landscape paintings,whose main objects are natural landscapes, one-point linear perspective,which is linear perspective with a single vanishing point, was introduced the most. In addition, in subject matters where one was to sketch spaces in solid geometry such as regular hexahedrons and rectangular parallelepipeds, there were many contents showing the methods and principles of linear perspective. For students, learning perspective can be seen as a method indispensable for the process of perceiving and visualizing the real world. Spatial intelligence in Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligence theory is one of the human abilities that can be developed in the fine arts. In particular, perspective representation is an indispensable object of the ability to perceive and visualize space in the surrounding world. In addition, perspective representation operates as an important element for perceiving and understanding the space expressed in artworks in art appreciation classes as well. },

  abstract={ The competence-based model focuses on acquiring skills and abilities, yet each student's individual circumstances condition the way in which they learn, develop, and implement them. Accordingly, there is a growing interest in defining learning activities that consider the diverse range of intelligences, abilities, and prevailing mindsets in each individual in order to promote inclusive education and sustainable development. This article seeks to design a methodology for the teaching-learning resources associated with the nature of the prevailing intelligence in the competence-based model. Thus, the competence-intelligence-resource triangle was proposed for promoting inclusive education in the degree in Management Engineering at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). A total of 99 teaching-learning resources, 11 competences, and 9 types of intelligence were combined. As far as the multiple intelligence approach is concerned, the 50 students surveyed prioritized logical-mathematical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, linguistic, and spatial intelligences. As a conclusion, the use of teaching-learning resources designed for promoting different types of intelligence in the competence-based model constitutes an adaptive strategy for the students to successfully acquire competences. },

  abstract={ Participants from Argentina (N = 217) estimated their own, their partner's, their parents' and their grandparents' overall and multiple intelligences. The Argentinean data showed that men gave higher overall estimates than women (M = 110.4 vs. 105.1) as well as higher estimates on mathematical and spatial intelligence. Participants thought themselves slightly less bright than their fathers (2 IQ points) but brighter than their mothers (6 points), their grandfathers (8 points), but especially their grandmothers (11 points). Regressions showed that participants thought verbal and mathematical IQ to be the best predictors of overall IQ. Results were broadly in agreement with other studies in the area. A comparison was also made with British data using the same questionnaire. British participants tended to give significantly higher self-estimates than for relatives, though the pattern was generally similar. Results are discussed in terms of the studies in the field. },

  abstract={ This study examines the structure of self-estimates of intelligence (SEI) across 12 nations (Australia, Austria, Brazil, France, Iran, Israel, Malaysia, South Africa, Spain, Turkey, UK and US). Participants rated themselves on general and specific abilities from three popular models of intelligence: Gardner's multiple intelligences, Sternberg's triarchic theory of intelligence, and Goleman's emotional intelligence. The results showed that (a) laypeople across nations have similar and invariant concepts of intelligence, (b) concepts of intelligence are cross-culturally closely related to academic notions of intellectual ability and (c) sex differences in general and specific SEI favouring men are consistent across countries. Male hubris and female humility in SEI seem independent of sex differences in actual cognitive ability and national levels of masculinity-femininity. Furthermore, international mean differences in general SEI could not be attributed to discrepancies in national intelligence quotient (IQ) levels or to cultural variations. },

  abstract={ Although a growing line of research has targeted the efficacy of multiple intelligence-based instructions on learners??? language learning and oral communication skills, studies exploring and incorporating the effects of multiple intelligence-based instructions on second language pragmatics development in general and politeness markers, in particular, are rare. The current study attempted to investigate the relative effect of multiple intelligence-based instructions on the politeness markers development. To this aim, thirty intermediate EFL learners studying New Interchange series in language institutes in Tabriz, Iran with the age range 13-17 were employed. McKenzie???s multiple intelligences questionnaires were conducted to pinpoint the participants??? dominant intelligences. Thus, the participants were assigned to two multiple-intelligence based experimental groups (A and B) and a control group. The results of two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (time ?? group) revealed that the participants in the experimental groups outperformed those in the control group in both comprehension/production posttests and delayed posttests, while there was not any significant difference between the experimental groups in the two testing occasions. Therefore, it can be concluded that adopting teaching methods and materials consistent with learners??? MIs would conspicuously enhance pragmatic competence. },

For this purpose, a questionnaire composed of open and closed questions was applied. The answers were analyzed by means of Textual Discourse Analysis. After analyzing the data, it was possible to observe that 60% of the teachers stated that they make use of the L.S in the classroom context. The main L.S observed were conceptualized within the visual-auditory framework, as well as the style proposed by David Kolb and Gardner's Multiple Intelligences. },

  abstract={ Previously, language teaching has been focused on the passive learning of the alphabet. In addition, the research on teaching listening and speaking skills was limited. Listening skill is the key to learning a language, and speaking is the first explicit behavior of language. In order to improve language skills which are emphasized in new curriculum guidelines, student-centered thematic language teaching is considered as valuable. Through this, the concepts of multiple intelligences and curriculum integration were re-emphasized. An experimental design was adopted in the current study. This study was conducted with the participation of 224 students from the Department of Multimedia Design in universities in the south of Taiwan. The research data were collected between September 2021 and December 2021. The implementation process took 16 weeks (a total of 48 h) of thematic language teaching. The research results revealed 1. significant positive effects of thematic language teaching on listening, 2. significant positive effects of thematic language teaching on speaking skill, and 3. significant negative effects of thematic language teaching on learning anxiety. According to the results, it is expected that this study can help multimedia design students improve their listening and speaking skills as well as core language skills. },

In total, 633 individuals varying in rural or urban location, ethnicity (Malay, Kadazan, and Bajau), and sex (women versus men) provided their self-assessed overall intelligence and ten multiple intelligences. In general, results of a series of univariate analyses of variance showed that urban participants tended to have higher SAI than their rural counterparts and that men reported higher SAI than women. There was also a significant main effect of ethnicity, with Malays generally having lower estimates than Bajaus and Kadazans, respectively. There were few significant interactions between ethnicity, urban-rural location, and sex. These data present the first concurrent investigation of ethnic, rural-urban, and sex differences in SAL and are discussed in relation to previous theoretical discussions of SAI.

Participants were individuals in an adolescent literacy course who were future teachers of middle and secondary content subjects. They were initially skeptical about using artwork to support their content and serve as a catalyst for reading and writing. Based on their written reflections, however, attitudes changed dramatically following their experiences at the art museum and their application of the images to specific issues in their subject specialization. Analysis of their feedback showed perceived benefits to fall into five categories: (1) increased understanding of ways to integrate content, (2) development of additional resources, (3) practice thinking outside the proverbial box, (4) the ability to provide for multiple intelligences and learning preferences, and (5) an opportunity to get out of the classroom. Such benefits, they concluded, better prepared them as teachers. },

The study provides an analysis of a questionnaire on the command of these codes by two groups of students, a group of Spanish foreign language learners and a group of native speakers of Spanish. The results from the native group are the basis for drawing up a selection of appropriate visual and musical contents for the Spanish-as-a-foreign-language classroom according to their frequency and popularity in the target language and culture. The results of the study show that, in the area of Spanish for foreigners, knowledge of visual and musical cultural content does not depend on the students' level of Spanish. },

  abstract={ We are indiscriminately exposed to various emotional stimuli of uncritical and powerful images of modern society. Thus, our emotion is conforming to a single standard and losing its nature. To solve this problem, we suggesteda new emotional education methodology, ‘Brainbow’ by focusing on body performance.Brainbow consists of seven different types of emotional intelligence educations,based on the idea of multiple intelligence theory for brain activity spatial,linguistic, body-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and mathematical emotional intelligences. Each part of the multiple emotional intelligences can be developed through creative performance by using body movement and voice withoutany educational tools. The advantages of Brainbow are easy accessibility as a play, simultaneous development of multiple intelligences to maximize its effect, and overall harmonization of intellectual, physical, and emotional educations. We expect that Brainbow will be a very effective emotional education methodology, returning to the nature of emotion and escaping from the distorted and standardized emotion in modern society. },

Several studies have identified MI in school children; nevertheless, in Mexico, these studies have been scarce. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the differences of MI between genders and the grades-in-school of Mexican elementary schoolchildren. In an effort to investigate the differences of MI in elementary school children in Mexico, we provided a self-administered questionnaire to 161 Mexican students. Overall, our findings showed that the students' mean averages in the eight categories of MI were similar in both genders; in fact, the only significant differences in gender were found in intrapersonal intelligence (males reporting higher intrapersonal differences than females). No other significant differences in MI were found, nor were there interaction effects between gender and the grade in school. In summary, these results give us an understanding that the different types of MI may not be that well implemented in elementary school children. },

This has a negative influence on the establishment of children's faith. It treats Christianity as 'a good opinion' or the same as other religions. In order to cope with the spirit of a pluralistic age, this writer dealt with two suggestions for Christian parents to encourage their children to have faith. First, Christian parents should 'be innocent as doves' as they set up a faith identity. In this manner they hold the core of the Gospel and build to the meta-narrative of the Creation, Fall and Salvation. Secondly, Christian parents should be 'as shrewd as snakes.' In this manner they nurture their children's multiple intelligences. This will help parents to figure out their children's strengths, abilities, interests, and motivation and to form children's faith relevantly and effectively. },

  abstract={ The definitions of the gifted and giftedness have expanded from the narrow concept in the past to the current concept. Terman in the 1920s defined gifted students as 'those who are in the top 1% of the Stanford-Binet intelligence test'. Unlike Terman, Renzulli considered those who have above-average intelligence, high creativity, and task commitment to be gifted. Gagne’s differentiated model regards gifted as those who potentially are in the top 10%, not limiting them to the top 1%. Sternberg stressed that giftedness is influenced by environmental and social contexts and Gardner argued that giftedness consists of multiple intelligences. This change in the definitions of giftedness has included many more gifted students who were not included in the scope of gifted by the prior definitions, and educational opportunities have expanded accordingly. In this paper, various definitions of the gifted and giftedness are reviewed and the strengths and limitations of these definitions and their implications for gifted education have been suggested. },

In this study, I show that while experts criticize genetic talent testing as unscientific, the persistence of genetic talent testing is not merely a product of parents' scientific illiteracy. Instead, genetic talent testing reflects parents' pragmatic use of technology in response to the parenting pressures in contemporary China. Parents see the results of genetic talent testing as offering an advantage for their children when combined with the intensive parenting strategy of precision education. Drawing on the sociology of testing, I argue how genetic talent testing in China is a product of broader concerns about population quality and can potentially reshape how parents imagine quality children through the theory of multiple intelligences. My study of this off label use of direct-to-consumer genetic testing also suggests that scientists need to broaden their imagination of potential misuses of their technologies. },

  abstract={ Numerous scientific researchers have been pointing to the connection between certain music activities and development of the non-musical competencies. Learning to play a musical instrument contributes to the development of the multiple intelligences elements. The aim of this work is to determine whether there is a connection between the learning process and the activity of playing a musical instrument in elementary school and the selection of secondary school type and occupation. In this research the following questions were considered: whether playing a musical instrument during elementary school age is connected with the process of choosing secondary school and occupation, with the overall success of the respondents in elementary and secondary school, their success in Mathematics, the level of future education and the knowledge of foreign languages. A total of 283 respondents of various age groups participated in this research, and they were divided into two categories: the respondents who were played a musical instrument during elementary school age and the respondents who did not. },

  abstract={ This study investigated the relationship between sex, attitude toward intelligence, and self-estimation of lay views about intelligence for self and parents among Portuguese adolescents in secondary schools. Four-hundred and fifty adolescents from Portugal estimated their own and their parents' IQ scores on each of Apter's eight multiple intelligences: telic, paratelic, negativistic. conformist, autic mastery, autic sympathy, alloic mastery, and alloic sympathy. Males rated themselves higher on overall and autic sympathy intelligence compared to females; females rated themselves higher on alloic sympathy intelligence compared to males. The higher participants rated their own intelligence, the higher they tended to rate that of others. Multiple regressions indicated that negativistic, conformist, and autic mastery intelligences were significant predictors for self- and parents overall IQ estimations. Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the self-estimates of intelligence, as well as limitations of that approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. },

Participants (N = 128) aged between 3 and 4 years from a preschool in a northeastern city of China were divided into the experimental and the control groups based on their gender and age. The experimental group underwent training in using the app twice a week for 12 weeks, while the control group followed regular activities. Gaze duration (which indicates sustained attention) and first fixation latency (which reveals attention orientation speed) were analyzed before and after the training. Although Children's fixation latency was not associated with the intervention, compared to the control group, the experimental group showed significant improvement in gaze duration, suggesting a better-sustained attention development. The result reinforces the previous findings that educational digital game apps could promote young children's attention development. },

This project aims to analyze the benefits of music therapy in the comprehensive training of students with disruptive behaviors (n = 6). Tests designed by Gallego, Alonso, Cruz, and Lizama (1999) were conducted to assess emotional intelligence, which showed very low results. A series of activities were designed based on the use of the music videogame Musichao, the curricular content of which was adapted for this pilot experience. Subsequently, the emotional intelligence tests were applied again to determine the effectiveness of the teaching experience. The results indicate that, with the use of this videogame, significant improvements were obtained, both in the development of multiple intelligences and in self-motivation, self-awareness, self-control, and more specifically, in social skills, minimizing behaviors that were classified as inappropriate and/or aggressive, and becoming more skilled in their interactions with the surrounding environment. },

  abstract={ Despite the breadth and depth of educational neuroscience research and teachers' interest in neuroscience, teachers often have limited access to reputable sources. As a result, neuromyths-misapplied or over-simplified claims related to brain science-have proliferated. School Psychologists have training in education, applied neuroscience, and evidence-based practices. As such, school psychologists are poised to mitigate the negative impact of teacher neuromyth endorsement. This study examined the endorsement rate of neuromyths by teachers to identify knowledge gaps to inform future training in this area. In-service and preservice teachers from grades K-12 completed an online survey of common neuromyths. Many neuromyths are pernicious and continue to be endorsed by teachers, most commonly related to learning styles and multiple intelligences. These results support the need for increased training in neuroscience for teachers and suggest a desire for factual and useful information about educational neuroscience, which school psychologists can provide in educational contexts. },

  abstract={ The traditional civil engineering-based approach to construction engineering and management education focuses significant attention on core subjects such as scheduling, estimating, and contracts. This paper introduces an alternative approach to this education based on the concepts of project-based learning. Through the introduction of courses developed by the writers, the paper provides a foundation for changing current education approaches from a lecture-based format to a project-based format. In this format, students are challenged with open-ended problems requiring greater application of multiple engineering concepts as well as requiring interaction with outside experts from within the construction industry and related professions. An outline for a project-based learning course is presented with experiences and lessons learned from four implementations of the course. Student responses are presented to indicate the potential benefits of such an approach. This finding is further supported by the introduction of the Knowledge Landscape concept for construction education that emphasizes greater use of context, scope, and multiple intelligences in construction engineering education. },

The two constructs were organized in terms of eight dimensions each: the basis for developing two questionnaires that were completed by 618 undergraduate engineering students, in an attempt to define their student profile. Three alternative measures were designed to determine numerical values for each dimension, according to their capacity to predict academic performance in terms of final grades, using regression analysis. According to the study's findings, the logical/mathematical dimension plays an important role in student performance, while anxiety has a negative effect on final grades. The definition of appropriate measures to determine students' cognitive, affective, and self-regulatory profiles can provide instructors with timely information to implement appropriate teaching strategies in their groups. },

To answer this question, several demographic (i.e., gender, grade) and psychological (i.e., multiple intelligences, emotional intelligence, intellectual aptitude, and divergent thinking) characteristics of 563 secondary students nominated as gifted by their teachers were analyzed. Results showed a general gifted profile of the nominated students defined by higher scores in their naturalist and social intelligences, stress management, and verbal, mechanical, and spatial reasoning. Additional analysis indicated that students' gender and grade also influenced teachers' nominations of gifted students. Based on the associations among the demographic and psychological characteristics included in this study, nominated students could be classified in five specific gifted profiles, namely, moderately gifted students, social-emotionally gifted students, artistically gifted students, intellectually gifted students, and generally gifted students. Discussion of the limitations of the study, directions for future research, and educational implications of the study are provided. },

Teachers (108) of similar ethnicities from 4 elementary schools were observed to determine level of implementation (high, medium, low) of a constructivist‐based curriculum model incorporating Multiple Intelligences theory (Gardner, 1983), the theory of Triarchic Mind (Sternberg, 1985), research on creativity, and principles for education of gifted students. ANOVA results showed significant increases in creativity of students in middle and high implementers’ classrooms in Year 2 and significant interaction effects across all 3 years: as grade level increased, TCT‐DP scores of students in high and middle implementer classrooms while those in low implementers’ classrooms decreased. This study lends support for the use of this model, but additional research is needed. },

This study has been motivated by the perceived clear issues faced in the selection and development of those who are gifted at art. In examining this issue, this study aims to analyze the procedures, available expertise and provision of educational courses used in the selection process for those who are gifted at art, in addition to providing discussion on the concept for the gifted in art itself. In terms of methodology, the study adopts a sample group method, taken from the gifted in art within elementary schools, while there is also an evaluation offered of the leadership of the Seoul Metropolitan Office of Education in terms of the selection of the gifted in art. Furthermore, analysis is also given of the pathways and development tendencies of those selected as gifted at art post-selection. The results in this study provide evidence of the legitimacy of education for the gifted at art at the elementary school level. },

  year={ 2018 },
  volume={ 37 },
  issn={ 1229-7682 },
  abstract={ This article is to propose a postconventional curriculum to create a new perspective of Christian identity for the elderly through understanding the ‘non-relationship’ death of elders living alone in Korea (who died without any relation of circumstances). Since it is vital for the elders to recognize the necessity of the life of self-integration and the death education in aging era, this study is meaningful for elders to build postconventional curriculum. Recently, Korea has rapidly adapted to the terms of the ‘non-relation- ship’death that came from the Japanese society, which has entered a su- per-aged society. Therefore, this study points out the need to gain a mature sense of self-respectiveness for their lives from an individual's cognitive point of view and to overcome the death anxiety beyond the understanding of so- cial diseases. Recognizing the possibility of Korea becoming a super-aged society, this study will discuss the purpose, content of education, and teach- ing models for the new forms of ‘postconventional identity’and ‘postconventional curriculum’for the Aged learners of Christian Education in recently. The purpose of Christian (religious) education for elderly is to en- able the elderly to acquire the “postconventional identity” as a self and crea- tive learners beyond the conventional doctrine of education carried out in the christian community. Also, the content of education includes three key principles in the form of “postconventionality”:1) “relationality”for solidarity within small groups, 2) “equality”of non-authority who respects and listens to various voices without racial or gender discrimination, and 3) “openness” that performs self-integrated understanding and practical praxis about self and others. Also the models of “ postconventional curriculum “ would like to propose as follows, 1) The connected Teaching model by Thomas Groom through the Narrative(story) of method , 2) Praix model by Paulo Freire that breaks the silence and respects various voices, and 3) The Understanding of Teaching model by Howard Gardner that promotes a diverse range of talents. Teachers, above all, should support their learning needs and experi- ences, taking into account the characteristics of older learners in a non-curriculum. },

Nevertheless, at this time, the means to achieve this curriculum are not being prepared in our educationail arena. The means would include curriculum materials, experienced teachers in this field, role models, standardized test modules, teacher evaluation guidelines. Thus a fruitful direction for future research would be to address these concerns. },

  abstract={ Targets have been designed that produce moderate to high gain when directly driven by lasers. The intrinsic sensitivity of these targets to hydro instabilities is found using the FAST(2D) multidimensional radiation hydrocode [J. H. Gardner, A. J. Schmitt, J. P. Dahlburg , Phys. Plasmas 5, 1935 (1998)], which simulates the simultaneous behavior of a large bandwidth (e.g., l=2-256) of perturbations from compression to acceleration, and then to stagnation and burn. The development of the structure in these multimode simulations is benchmarked to theoretical analysis and single-mode calculations, which reveals the need to renormalize the simulation after compression. The simulations predict that a direct drive point design is expected to degrade significantly from its one-dimensional clean yield, yet still ignite and give appreciable gain. Simulations of high-gain pellets using a spike prepulse to inhibit Richtmyer-Meshkov growth show a considerable robustness, with high (>100) gains possible even with nominal surface finishes and laser imprint.

  abstract={ This article arises from the need to reflect upon the possibility of developing new ways of teaching electroacoustic music, based on the opportunities recently offered by technology and the theories about learning that have been developed in recent decades. After taking into consideration the limits of the current teaching methods, the article examines various theories and approaches that involve questioning the objectivity of the learning process, the concept of multiple intelligences, the concentration on the experience as the focal point of learning and so forth. On the basis of these reflections, and after evaluating various teaching experiences over the past twenty years, the authors make some practical proposals, without imagining a curriculum, but rather by outlining several possible activities within an organic teaching project. To this end, a software program is described and realised in which the learner is engaged through the use of an interactive game format that can be played by the individual or in a group, and that encourages the development of the capacities of analysis, perception, practical skill, knowledge, imagination and creativity. },

The methodology used includes qualitative research as a guide, seeking to collect key data to understand the behavior, motivations and characteristics of students who have a particular rhythm in the teaching-learning process. In addition, Project-Based Learning is integrated as a facilitator to address various needs present in the classroom and in the individual environment of each student. As a result of the research and with the timely intervention of technology, it is sought that the student body be the center of their learning process. Finally, the importance of the school striving to effectively develop the eight types of intelligence and decentralize the role of the teacher, giving a leading role to the student, is highlighted. },

Drawing from the multiple intelligences view that AI advances from mechanical, to thinking, to feeling intelligence (based on how difficult for AI to mimic human intelligences), the framework posits that collaboration between AI and HI (human marketers and consumers) can be achieved by 1) recognizing the respective strengths of AI and HI, 2) having lower-level AI augmenting higher-level HI, and 3) moving HI to a higher intelligence level when AI automates the lower level. Implications for marketers, consumers, and researchers are derived. Marketers should optimize the mix and timing of AI-HI marketing team, consumers should understand the complementarity between AI and HI strengths for informed consumption decisions, and researchers can investigate innovative approaches to and boundary conditions of collaborative intelligence.

In the intervention, the teacher used the tools of the journal of notes and continuous interviews with key informants of the participant observation to find out these aspects and design the quantitative tool, a questionnaire in which the sample composed of 112 students participated. The results highlight teamwork, emotional intelligence, multiple intelligences, and project-based learning. They also highlighted three activities in which they were protagonists of their own learning and a visit from a writer. Regarding desired practices, the results are not significant, although gamification stands out. Regarding the classroom climate, they stressed that it was emotionally good, with social acceptance, with sense of humor and among a positive evaluation from the teacher and classmates, with whom they worked comfortably. },

Because intrapersonal intelligence is the basis and driving force for activating other multiple intelligences, it is essential for learning and self-achievement. The research questions are as follows. 1) How do the activities in S-L affect the intrapersonal intelligence of participant students? 2) How does the participation motive affect intrapersonal intelligence? As a result of analyzing the pre-post survey data of 303 S-L students, the activities in S-L had significantly positive effect on their intrapersonal intelligence. The first-year students showed the most changes, and fourth-grade students showed the least. The students with high intrinsic motivation showed the greatest improvement in intrapersonal intelligence. This study will be useful in such a way that it can verify the educational potential of S-L centered on 'reflection' and lays the basis for developing various intelligences and capabilities based on intrapersonal intelligence developed through S-L. },

However, there is a lack of evidence of its psychometric properties in diverse population using multivariable techniques and also to corroborate its relationship with other variables of the Social Cognitive Carrier Theory model. The aim of this study is to validate a version of the Professional Interests Questionnaire. 412 students from the last year of secondary education participated in this study. The factorial analyzes corroborated the existence of fifteen sub-scales with a total of 145 items that explain 61,88% of the variance, a Cronbach's alpha of,945 and an adequate adjustment of the global model (RMSEA=0,061, GIF=0,92) as incremental (AGFI=0,90, NFI=0,86) which ratifies its validity and reliability. Significant relationships between the sub-scales and the selfefficacy dimensions for multiple intelligences are also confirmed. The study provides an appropriate instrument for individual vocational counseling and development of university admission and retention policies. },

In the fourth industrial revolution, many jobs are supposed to be replace by machine and AI, new types of industries will be emerged. In order to deal with the industrial change, the creative person who is able to combine different domain knowledge is required. For that, a person has to develop abilities and learn knowledge in various fields. According to the theory of multiple intelligence, an intelligence is composed of eight criteria.Since the IQ test focuses linguistic, mathematical, and logical intelligence, the improvement of multiple intelligences is limited. For balanced intelligence improvement, weak intelligence should be further improved. In this paper, we propose the smart device application to efficiently improve the weak intelligence. We conducted multiple intelligence test for elementary school student and determined two weak intelligences. Students learned through smart device application, and we confirmed that the test results improve. },

This capacity that constitutes one of the multiple intelligences of the human being deserves special consideration for being the ability that allows us to understand, manage and recognize emotions, motivate oneself and direct social relations. Material and Method: This study put the focus of interest on students between 3 and 16 years with Autism Spectrum Disorder in order to know what their most significant emotional disagreements are in the school and family environment. To achieve this purpose, a descriptive study has been carried out through a questionnaire addressed to parents and another to educators. Results: The results confirm the difficulties of the group to develop one of the eight-intelligences of the human being. Conclusion: In the same way, it reflects the need to forge a common commitment, by the entire educational community, to be able to offer an inclusive and quality response while continuing to develop new lines of research. },

This paper argues that the independent intelligences research program is degenerating, since it has not led to novel, empirically corroborated predictions. However, despite its flaws, the program provides an illustrative example of some of the philosophical problems that inhere in Lakatos's so-called methodology. Indeed, Lakatos's conceptions of the negative heuristic, the positive heuristic, and the relationship between scientific appraisal and advice are all vulnerable to objections. The upshot is that theories of independent intelligences indeed teach us more about philosophy of science than about the nature of human intelligence. },

It aimed to reach pre-complementary information by using meta-analytical and thematic examinations based on document analysis in the first stage of McA, which consists of using different analysis programs and of three basic stages. 63 studies examining the effect of the MIT were selected for meta-analytical research. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis and MetaWin programs were used for data analysis. In order to support the meta-analysis, a qualitative dimension including a detailed examination of the thematic aspects of the data was added to the first stage. The data was analyzed via the QSR-Nvivo-8.0 program in accordance with the case study design. In the second stage of the McA, an experimental dimension and the thematic analysis based on students' views were conducted. The working group was selected from 12th grade high school students and the data obtained from them was considered to be post-complementary information. The process of combining the data in two stages was done in order to reach complementary information in the synthesis stage. The McA is expected to contribute to the extent and reliability of the research. },

As a result, a STEAM program with twenty (20) unit hours for elementary schools was developed and a subsequent quantitative analysis was applied to confirm that this program contributes to improving the awareness on environmental, social, and economic sustainability in education for sustainable development (ESD). The developed ESD-STEAM program was reported to contributes to evenly improving students' logical-mathematical intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, musical intelligence, visual-spatial intelligence, and naturalistic intelligence. In addition, the qualitative analysis results focusing on students’ responses, educational experiences and positive meanings were identified in creativity factor, recognition, psychomotor, and affective domain. In other words, the ESD-STEAM program on multiple intelligence theory can be regarded as an effective way to supplement the convergence characteristics of STEAM education in depth. },

The data were analyzed using the SPSS version 27 statistical software, and univariate and bivariate analyses were carried out according to the three grouping dimensions: (a) brain functioning, (b) multiple intelligences and learning styles, and (c) language learning. The results indicate the prevalence of neuromyths related to general concepts, which determine the learning comprehension. This corroborates the findings of research studies in other contexts. Although the participants do not show a prevalence of neuromyths regarding foreign language learning, presumably due to their experiences in multilingual contexts, which constitutes the main contribution of this study. },

The ECPC suggests that the contents of the ECPC should be toward actions and problem-solving, which is called ‘project’ in the classroom. The model of teaching English on the basis of the ECPC comprises three kinds of contents. They are Nuri-Curriculum as teaching goals, multiple intelligences as instructional settings, and hierarchies of knowledge as teaching methods. The procedures of the teaching model have the four steps, which are prepare, practice, perform, and assess. In the process of the model puzzles which are specially designed to have the children think in solving a problem are used. (Jeonju National University of Education & Konyang University) },

The program used seven children's books on the subject of food and nutrition, and included diverse learning activities based on Multiple Intelligences. The subjects were divided into two groups: control and experimental. The control group took only the regular practical arts lessons, while the experimental group took the additional lessons of this program. The results were as followed. First, the food preferences of the experimental group increased for various foods, expecially fish, beans, vegetables, and seaweed, for which their preferences had been low, while their preferences for processed foodstuffs decreased. Second, the eating behavior of the experimental group improved more than that of the control group. Thus, this program had positive effects on the children's food preferences and eating behavior. Programs such as these can help children to participate in learning activities with greater interest, and to learn various subjects in books. In addition, this study suggests that children's books can be valuable materials in nutrition education. },

The data were analysed with descriptive statistics and Pearson’s correlation using SPSS PC program(16.0 version). Major findings were as follows: Teachers had the highest levels in interpersonal intelligence, followed by musical intelligence and linguistic intelligence; interpersonal intelligence and linguistic intelligence accounted for an especially high proportion of their teaching and learning plans. The higher a preschool teacher’s physical activity intelligence, the greater the proportion of physical exercise, music, and logic and mathematics in their teaching plans. It was also found that preschool teachers with higher levels linguistic intelligence made more plans on self-understanding, whereas preschool teachers with higher levels of intelligence in the observation and investigation of nature made more plans on spatial area. },

  abstract={ Reading comprehension skill is often assumed by sociology instructors, yet many college students seem to have marginal reading comprehension skills, which may explain why fewer than half of them are actually doing the reading. Sanctions that force students to either read or to pay a price are based on a rational choice model of behavior-a perspective that many students seem to bring with them. However, deep reading-reading for long-term retention of the material and for comprehension at a level that can be perspective-transforming-involves constructing meaning as one reads. Students need help developing reading strategies that enhance this process. Moreover, cost/benefit coercion of reading does not necessarily enhance construction of meaning or deep-learning; indeed, it may reward minimalist or surface reading. This essay is an excursion into theory on deep learning and the implications of that theory for engaging students in reading. An assignment based on multiple intelligences and fostering reading comprehension is suggested and some initial data are provided regarding possible success of this strategy. },

In this study we report for the first time the effect of several Metal ions as catalytic agents of lipid peroxidation on the production of total THODs by PR3. Among eight different metal ions tested. Fe+2 and Cu+2 were effective to produce THODs. However bacterial growth was not significantly affected by the existence of metal ions tested. Fe+2 ion requirement was specific to THOD production from linoleic acid but not to other incorporation of dihydroxyl group on oleic acid and ricinoleic acid by PR3. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

  abstract={ This article explores pedagogical experiments that demonstrate a renewed utility for art education in the future. I will discuss the philosopher Nelson Goodman’s Project Zero, housed at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education. Project Zero is a long-term study of cognitive effects and scholastic outcomes of greater student exposure to art and philosophical methods in general schooling. Continuing this project into the second generation, Howard Gardener’s cognitive psychology research studies the effects of a wide exposure to art education and interdisciplinary education. Project Zero is one major example how the philosophical spirit is possible in art education even in our digital ‘app generation.’ I will explore associated researcher Jessica Davis and her books “Why Our Schools Need the Arts” and “Why Our High Schools Need the Arts.” In general, I examine the question how art and philosophical education connects to improved empathetic and creative abilities for those in our new digital society. Finally, I argue art education is more important than before due to the cultural needs for greater creative thinking, imagination and problem solving. Project Zero embraces these curricular ideas through this creative education, and so it is a useful alternative model to review for a better connection between school and society. },

The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of music education in college on the development of individuals' musical and creative abilities in comparison to self-taught musicians. The assessment involved the analysis of these aptitudes of the respondents using two separate techniques: Gardner's Multiple Intelligences Test to identify respondents' musical aptitudes and Williams' test battery to investigate divergent thinking. Given the timeliness and correctness of the execution of instructions for each of the tests, the original study sample included 190 individuals. Analysis of the research findings on the two parameters among the majority of respondents confirmed the expected correlation. As for the first factor of the analysis, approximately 53% of the respondents with musical intelligence demonstrated the expected correlation of this indicator with attendance of educational institutions. This being the case, 57% of respondents have a high level of creative thinking given attendance of a college of music. },

In Biology class, field trip is one of the keys when students want to observe natural phenomena. This study aim to identify student multiple intelligences and scientific reasoning profile as a reference in designing a field trip for high school students on ecosystem topics. The subjects in this study were 55 students from two classes of 10th grade in even semester with purposive sampling. Data collection using Teen MIDAS (15-19 years) to identify student multiple intelligence and TOLT instruments for student scientific reasoning profile. The results of this study indicate that there are 3 types of intelligence that are most prominent, namely naturalistic, interpersonal and logical-mathematical as for future reference to dividing groups based on these three intelligences. In addition, student scientific reasoning which was found to be at 66% formal operation, 22% transitional and 12% concrete operation stage indicated that the design of the field trip that had to be prepared to have a level of analysis with one or two variables. There are still many students who have not been able to solve combinatorial reasoning. Thus it can be concluded that the best field trip design for this group of student is a design with worksheet that featured naturalistic, interpersonal and logical-mathematical with no more than two variables involved. },

  abstract={ Purpose - Project claim performance is often poor with negative consequences for project-based organizations (PBOs). Conflict and emotion are reported to impact organizational claim performance outcomes, yet remains unexplored. This study investigates the multiple intelligence (MI) context from the viewpoint of the claim management office (CMO), with the intent of identifying pathways to improving the emotion-based claim performance of PBOs. Design/methodology/approach - The study utilizes an autoethnographic case study involving a PBO-based general contractor (GC). Multiple intelligence theory (MIT) is applied as the theoretical lens. Method of framework analysis is used in analyzing the data, with reference to claim management office (RFCMO) theory as a main source in making analytic generalization. Findings - Multifaceted complexities of MIs are identified, including ambidexterity, actions and relations, stress and conflict, cultural differences and universals, meta-strategic thinking and team diversity. The holistic emotion-based strategies model identifies how PBOs can improve claim performance, specifically by adopting theories confection remedy and controlling emotion outcomes strategies in a closed-loop process. Further, the coherent emotions governance (CEG) framework enables CMOs' to upgrade maturity levels, by integrating the strategies, general and specific measures for improving emotion-based organizational claim performance. Originality/value - This is a pioneering study in unveiling the complexities of organizational emotions engagement and the application of confection remedy, specifically in a project management context. The antecedents of RFCMO theory are here enriched with MIT and the pool of the supporting people-centered theories, augmented by an autoethnographic case study, in which the linkage between emotion and conflict complexity is laid bare. Further, this study identifies how conflicts in construction industry can be mitigated by way of a discrete three-category theories confection remedy. },

  abstract={ The informational interview (II) is a career exploration technique typically used to seek advice and gain insight about a specific industry and career paths. lIs can be used broadly to support students' exploration of careers and beyond. While lIs are classically used by job seekers to identify potential positions to be filled, they can also be used to enhance postsecondary education (Decarie, 2010). In its simplest form, lIs present opportunities for students to have conversations with professionals who can serve as models for students' futures. Although this approach has been used in business school curricula (Mulvaney, 2003; Sheppard, 1989), it has not been used in other academic disciplines or faculties to any significant extent. As a form of experiential learning associated with superior educational outcomes, lIs activate both sides of the brain, create episodic memory and appeal to multiple intelligences. By pushing students out of their comfort zone to talk to working professionals, lIs promote the acquisition of tacit knowledge where they visualize their future selves. Beyond being used to promote effective career exploration, lIs can be used to facilitate institutional change towards more community engagement in inquiry-based learning and research theses in any discipline. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to develop and verify a Korean Diagnostic Scale of Multiple Intelligence(MI), which will be an alternative test to avoid problems with former Shearer's MI test and to adopt H. Gardner's suggestions to develop MI assessment. The test is developed 5 types; kindergartner, elementary lower grader, elementary upper grader, middle schooler, high schooler test. A form of test is diversified with 3 types; multiple-choice items for accomplishment, true or false items for ability, and self-reported items with likert scale for interest and ability. According to H. Gardner's suggestions, we have tried to reanalyze key component of MI, analyze an overlapping or hierarchical relationship between intelligences, develop intelligences-fair items, diversify form of item. We have developed a final standardized test through a primary, secondary preliminary-test analysis, and sampled 5,585 students by age, gender, and regional groups. As a result of this sampling test, we can get a norm score and compare individuals with other's score relatively. To verify this test, we analyzed behavior observation, mean, standard deviation, a percentage of correct answers, reliability of each test type, correlation between intelligence scales, Kruskal-Wallis test of mean rank of career choice by intelligences. As a result of correlation analysis between sub-intelligence scales, we can conclude that this MI test is satisfied with intelligence independent assumption. Besides, as non-parametric statistics test(Kruskal-Wallis) of career choice by intelligences, we can identify that MI is related with domain of career choice. This test is not a linguistic and logical-mathematical biased test but a intelligences-fair test. It makes us compare individual's potential with a norm score. Besides, it could be useful as a means of educational prescription or counsel in comparison with ability, interest, and accomplishment of individual. But this test is limited to do factor or correlation analysis between types of sub-test, because items are minimized for a time-constraint and a heavy burden of test receiver. But if it could be tested with increased items by two sessions, further research could be expected to get over this constraints and do a further validation analysis. },

More attention should be paid to students' emotions in higher education to enhance students' engagement in the classroom and improve social awareness (i.e., respecting others, understanding other perspectives, providing help to those who need it), motivation, and academic achievement. This article focuses on the implementation of practices that promote SEL in higher education and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs. The paper aims to assess the academic and behavioral-related outcomes of applying SEL in mineralogy, an Earth science introductory course in a four-year university. The results of the present paper reveal that instructional practices supporting SEL are suited for engaging and stimulating learners' multiple intelligences. The observed student course assessment performance suggests that integrating SEL may be a viable strategy for promoting student interest in science, building stress resilience, and creating more positive engagement with students. The instructional practices reported in this paper could support science instructors in designing teaching methods that promote self-management and social awareness to increase students' academic outcomes. },

To cultivate multiple intelligences in mathematics classrooms, integrating project-based learning into mathematics instruction can be a promising approach. In this study, we analyzed 15 elementary interns' project-based mathematics (PBM) lessons and observed their implementation at two public elementary schools in the southern United States. The findings revealed that the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) PBM lessons conducted by the interns shared five common features: (a) enhancing empathy and social awareness, (b) solving real-life mathematics-related problems, (c) utilizing personal strengths to enhance the utility of mathematics, (d) supporting wide-ranging and collective mathematics learning, and (e) cultivating personal responsibility in mathematical problem solving. We further discussed how these STEM PBM lessons guaranteed an opportunity to foster students' social and emotional learning competencies in mathematics classrooms. We conclude that PBM provides a practical way to effectively engage students and enhance learning purpose in elementary classrooms and recommend this innovative pedagogy to both novice and veteran elementary teachers. },

  abstract={ Over the years, intelligence and intelligence theory have received much attention in the critical literature. Attempts to define the construct of intelligence and to explain and classify individual differences in cognitive functions have been characterized by significant variability for decade.This purpose of this article is to take a closer look at the Comprehensive CHC theory.Some of the most popular models include Carroll's Three-Stratum Theory of Cognitive Abilities, Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences, the Cattell-Horn Fluid-Crystallized(Gf-Gc) theory, Feuerstein's Theory of Structural Cognitive Modifiability, the Luria-Das Model of Information Processing, and Sternberg's Triarchic Theory of Intelligence.The Cattell-Horn-Carroll(CHC) theory of cognitive abilities is considered to be one of the most well-validated model of cognitive abilities. CHC theory is grounded in more than half a century of factor analytic research, and developmental studies of cognitive abilities, genetic heritability research,and neurocognitive analyses have contributed to its validity base. CHC theory is a recent synthesis of the Cattell-Horn Gf-Gc theory and the Carroll three-stratum theory of cognitive abilities.CHC theory is a structured multiple intelligence theory that provides a framework to conductpsychoeducational assessments. },

Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.] seven primary mental abilities (verbal fluency, verbal comprehension, numerical ability, spatial visualization, memory, perceptual speed and reasoning) and four additional types of intelligence proposed by Gardner [Gardner, G. (1983). Frames of mind: the theory of multiple intelligences. New York: Basic Books.], namely musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence. Gender differences were identified for only some of the intelligence domains. Males rated their mathematical, logical and spatial intelligence higher than females, while females gave higher scores than males for musical and interpersonal intelligence. Furthermore, there was some direct evidence for the assumption that estimates of intelligence are susceptible to gender stereotypes. When controlling for gender stereotypes, sex-related differences in self-estimated types of intelligence were confined to mathematical abilities and memory with higher ratings of males in the former and higher ratings of females in the latter one. Finally, factor analyses suggested gender differences in the conceptualization of some aspects of intelligence. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. },

Not many young generations want to defend this heritage until it is eventually lost to time. As with oral literature, Awang Batil deserves to be defended; it is not just entertainment, but the elements of wisdom contained in his performance need to be interpreted. Accordingly, this study aims to identify and discuss the elements ofwisdom and intelligence inAwang Batil's performance. The main method of this study is field research through recording techniques, interviews, and direct notes. Awang Batil's performances' wisdom and intelligence are examined based on two perspectives: linguistic intelligence and musical intelligence. Linguistic intelligence discusses civilized pronunciation, language ability, and memory ability, while musical intelligence is seen from two aspects, namely musical instruments and poetry. Analysis proves that Awang Batil's performance highlights the wisdom and intelligence of a comforter through the Multiple Intelligences Theory. It is evident that Awang Batil is not just a 'village entertainer', but this oral narrative has successfully captivated the global community by holding many performances abroad. It is hoped that studies about Awang Batil will be increased so that it can be a reference for the new generation. },

The conclusions of this study are as follows. First, the levels of both multiple intelligence and social adaptive behavior were significantly higher in gifted elementary students compared to general ones on all sub-factores, indicating that the gifted elementary students are more adaptive in such constructs as self-efficacy, self-esteem, communicative skill, school life and interpersonal skill compared to general ones. Second, the association between multiple intelligence and social adaptive behavior was statistically significant both in gifted and general elementary students, indicating that the two constructs have close relation with each other. Third, for the gifted elementary students, the logical-mathematical and interpersonal intelligences had explanatory powers for self-efficacy, self-esteem, communicative skill, adaptation in school life, interpersonal skill while, for the general ones, intra- and inter-personal intelligences had explanatory powers for most domains of social adaptive behaviors, indicating that development of intelligences affecting the social adaptive behavior many have positive effects on social and emotional development of both gifted and general elementary students. },

  abstract={ Due to the highly instrumental, test-driven, learning that occurs in secondary education in Korea, EFL teachers at tertiary level face students who, while differing in terms of proficiencies, majors, and learning needs, tend to share a lack of English performance skills. Communicative competence is not yet part of the university entrance exam, so it receives little attention in secondary education, leaving tertiary educators the task of fostering this skill. This paper describes a Freshman English program which attempted to do this by applying recent findings in the fields of cognitive, affective and social learning, and by catering to differing learning needs and multiple intelligences. In order to do this, the researchers put together a student-centered program which encouraged students to take responsibility for their learning through making performance projects, assessing their performance skills, and continuously reflecting on their learning needs, goals and achievements. The program was in effect for four years, and results showed improvement in student confidence, motivation, and attitudes to learning, in addition to communicative competence and autonomy. In conclusion, it is suggested that the humanistic goals of the 7th National Curriculum are achievable at tertiary level. This will, however, involve teacher-training and reform of the test-driven learning environment. },

Goal 4 promotes quality education and Target 4.7 specifically addresses Education for Sustainability. However, creating a monitoring and evaluation framework for Target 4.7 has been challenging. The aim of this research was to develop a meaningful assessment process. We used a dialogical intervention across complementary expertises and piloted concepts in a trainer workshop. We then developed a modified competency framework, drawing on previous competency models but innovating through the addition of intrapersonal competencies, a self-reflective validation scheme, a focus on non-formal learning, and specific alignment with SDG 4.7 requirements. Through exploration of how such learning could be activated, we proposed the use of multiple intelligences. Education plays a synergistic role in achieving the aspirations embedded within Agenda 2030 and the SDGs. We concluded that Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) will require individuals to acquire key competencies', aligning with notions of transformational learning, in addition to other generic and context specific competencies. },

In the first, review the conventional method of learner classification by brain use area, information process, MI(multiple intelligences), emotional aspects. And it was restructured by the information processing method in three steps which are information receive, information processing, and information represent. It is proposed two methods, one is an integrated classification method by brain use area and the other is 3 step classification method by information processing. Integrated classification method is classified by the brain use area of learner, that is ‘the left brain-type’ and ‘right brain type’. Step by step method is classified information processing in 3 steps, those are information receive, information processing, information expression. Information receive step is extracted the 4 types by 2 criteria (auditory and visual type : experience and thinking type). Information processing step is extracted the 4 types by 2 criteria(tree and forest type : observation and experiment type). Expression step is extracted the 5 types by 5 MI. But these two methods has a complementary nature, and need to grasp the overall type by brain use area firstly, and classify 3 step by information processing stage secondary step. },

  abstract={ This article is a historical examination of how Western theorists created and utilized the intelligence concept and aligned it with racial classification to determine cognitive abilities. By the 1900s, Western theorists, without evidence, declared that intelligence exists as an inheritable, unchangeable mental condition. Influential Western theorists have exploited the intelligence concept to categorize the cognitive abilities of European descendants above that of non-Whites, particularly African-descended people as incessant deliberations emerged regarding the value of either cognitively superior or inferior racially defined groups. By interrelating geographical location with shared physical characteristics, Western theorists non-scientifically divided the human family based on physical similarities among people and referred to them as races. These theorists incorporated the intelligence concept with racial classification as a sociological principle for educational development. According to the Theory of Multiple Intelligences, however, everyone has one or more forms of several intelligences. Although this theory appears to portray a different understanding from the original intelligence concept, it categorizes racial groups and individuals as having fixed levels of cognitive ability. Emphasizing intelligence as a descriptive factor to determine cognitive ability is an unscientific, unequitable characterization that has been employed to explain levels of social awareness and academic performance in Western education. },

  abstract={ It is well recognized amongst psychologists that individuals exhibit not one but multiple intelligences (Gardner 1993). Perhaps the most conspicuous of these, especially in interpersonal contexts, is emotional intelligence: that ability to understand and predict one's own emotions, and those of others, and to use this information to guide one's thinking and behaviour (Mayer, Salovey and Caruso 2008). Although the Odyssean Odysseus is known for his ability to think his way out of difficult situations, his problem-solving ability is not his only distinguishing cognitive attribute. This paper begins with a brief discussion of emotional intelligence and its scope. I then observe how the poet, through his narrative, reveals this ability in Odysseus: his emotional intelligence serves the hero well in some social situations but (as happens to us all) fails him in others. I shall argue, with reference to a number of examples, that the poet has an implicit understanding of emotional intelligence; that he uses his hero's uneven performance with respect to this ability as a motivating factor in his development of the plot; and that this attribute of Odysseus, along with his craftiness, is what makes this character-and ultimately this story-so engaging. },

  abstract={ The introductory psychology class represents the first opportunity for the field to present new students with a comprehensive overview of psychological research. Writing introductory psychology textbooks is challenging given that authors need to cover many areas they themselves may not be intimately familiar with. This challenge is compounded by problems within the scholarly community in which controversial topics may be communicated in ideological terms within scholarly discourse. Psychological science has historically seen concerns raised about the mismatch between claims and data made about certain fields of knowledge, apprehensions that continue in the present replication crisis. The concern is that, although acting in good faith, introductory psychology textbook authors may unwittingly communicate information to readers that is factually untrue. Twenty-four leading introductory psychology textbooks were surveyed for their coverage of a number of controversial topics (e.g., media violence, narcissism epidemic, multiple intelligences) and scientific urban legends (e.g., Kitty Genovese, Mozart Effect) for their factual accuracy. Results indicated numerous errors of factual reporting across textbooks, particularly related to failing to inform students of the controversial nature of some research fields and repeating some scientific urban legends as if true. Recommendations are made for improving the accuracy of introductory textbooks. },

The frequency of each knowledge domain in answer was compared with the MI test results. As a result, preschoolers did not answer as their knowledges, concepts, stories, and theories which are relevant with asked questions, but as knowledges and logics which are selected by their preferred intellectual potential. Besides, the frequent answered domains are consistent with the strengths of MI test result. This findings could be interpreted that preschoolers construct their knowledges as independent domains, and that each individuals has their own developmental aspect and different knowledges as MI. The findings from characteristics of preschooler's knowledge make us reconsider about domain-specific intelligence and independence of MI theory. Besides, it imply that we need to develope a new investigating tool which is kept out of a overlapping and a grading of rank between eight MI of an antecedent test to reconsider an independence assumption of MI. },

The experiment was conducted with 106 participants (experimental group with 71 and control group with 35) out of total 176 third grade middle school students. The experimental group was involved in the seven-week intervention of vocabulary instruction based on the MI Theory. The assessment of MI based on K-MIDAS was used to obtain individual student’s MI profile and a questionnaire test was used to find the affective factors. The results are as follows: First, there was a significant difference in the academic achievement for reading comprehension between the experimental group and control group; Second, the students in the experimental group had higher scores in vocabulary recall/retention test; Third, the results of questionnaires showed that the students in the experimental group became more positive in respect to self-confidence and class participation than those in the control group. Findings suggest that teaching vocabulary using different activities based on students’ strong intelligences is a desirable way to develop their English reading comprehension and to motivate students to study English harder.

  abstract={ The current educational process faces multiple challenges, as it deals with relationships and with multiple intelligences. School education participates in these challenges. How to educate for the tolerance and social responsibility, taking into account the construction of a culture of peace, respect and care towards the difference? How could the discipline of Religious Education actively participate in the process of human formation? This study is part of a broader research on tolerance and promotion of a culture of peace in some public elementary schools in the suburbs of the city of Belo Horizonte / MG. Based on bibliographic and observational research, the study aims to conceive a pedagogical action with a dialogical focus. This action was called pedagogy of care and knowledge, since affection and knowledge need to coexist in the school environment to encourage constructive relationships. This reflection aims to present the results of the aforementioned research and propose care in interpersonal relationships, so that the school reaches desirable quality level, both at the intellectual and emotional levels. Dialogical relationships are built on valuing the human and for this very reason they remain. The exercise of interreligious dialogue in the school environment can be an opportunity and training in dialogical constructions, both by participating in school projects and in their development inside the classroom. },

  abstract={ The authors discuss the problem of providing a scientific substantiation of the cognitive technology applied for teaching physics; this technology can be applied both to the face-to-face and distant styles of teaching. The research is relevant as physics courses are filled with numerous abstract concepts. Failure in understanding an abstract concept results in the emerging obstacle in perceiving signs, symbols and terms. The authors suggest reducing this obstacle by applying the teaching technology based on (intra-) inter-subject connections and focused on stimulating targeted independent work. However, in-depth preliminary research is required. The authors have reviewed the definitions of cognition, cognitive psychology and science, cognitive technology and cognitive educational technology. Based on their analysis, they have established that interiorization, according to Lev Vygotsky, calls for established connections between information that enters consciousness and anticipative schemes - intellectual structures that emerged from the previous learning. However, the problem of establishing connections has not been raised or discussed before. The authors supplemented the interiorization process with establishment of connections and described the phenomenon of understanding based on this idea. This brought to light the specific features of didactic solutions in the cognitive theory of teaching. Inclusion of the establishing of connections that depends on the level of mental operations development (especially of analysis, synthesis and generalization) calls for a more specific and detailed definition of cognition. The concept of a semantic transfer was introduced; the specific features of defining cognitive technologies were brought to light; a definition of cognitive educational technology was suggested. The authors propose to include in didactic solutions hierarchic semantic structures of (intra-) inter-subject connections built with the method of semantic structures (Tatyana Gnitetskaya). The authors suggest applying cognitive educational technology in accordance with Howard Gardner's specific features of cognitive research: representation, computer, interdisciplinarity, exclusion of vague concepts, and philosophical problems as fundamentals of the universe. The results described in the article show that a project possesses specific features of cognitive research if the participants of the project are involved in targeted independent activities and the project is aimed at revealing inter-subject connections with the help of semantic structures, at interdisciplinarity, at generalizations that allow connecting the research subject to the world view. An enhanced cognitive efficiency of studying physics is achieved without using new neurotechnologies (neurodevices). A cognitive project can be realized in the context of any teaching mode - online or face-to-face; it can be applied at schools and universities. Organizing team contests within projects in physics can engage even low-level students and encourage them to strive for high performance. },

  abstract={ Objective: The objectives of this study were to examine common patterns in the lives and artwork of five artistic savants previously described and to report on the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging findings from one newly diagnosed artistic savant. Background: The artistic savant syndrome has been recognized for centuries, although its neuroanatomic basis remains a mystery. Methods: The cardinal features, strengths, and weaknesses of the work of these six savants were analyzed and compared with those of children with autism in whom artistic talent was absent. An anatomic substrate for these behaviors was considered in the context of newly emerging theories related to paradoxical functional facilitation, visual thinking, and multiple intelligences. Results: The artists had features of pervasive developmental disorder, including impairment in social interaction and communication as well as restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interest, and activities. All six demonstrated a strong preference for a single art medium and showed a restricted variation in artistic themes. None understood art theory. Some autistic features contributed to their success, including attention to visual detail, a tendency toward ritualistic compulsive repetition, the ability to focus on one topic at the expense of other interests, and intact memory and visuospatial skills. Conclusions: The artistic savant syndrome remains rare and mysterious in origin. Savants exhibit extraordinary visual talents along with profound linguistic and social impairment. The intense focus on and ability to remember visual detail contributes to the artistic product of the savant. The anatomic substrate for the savant syndrome may involve loss of function in the left temporal lobe with enhanced function of the posterior neocortex. },

  abstract={ With the recent advancements of learning analytics techniques, it is possible to build predictive models of student academic performance at an early stage of a course, using student's self-regulation learning and affective strategies (SRLAS), and their multiple intelligences (MI). This process can be conducted to determine the most important factors that lead to good academic performance. A quasi-experimental study on 618 undergraduate students was performed to determine student profiles based on these two constructs: MI and SRLAS. After calibrating the students' profiles, learning analytics techniques were used to study the relationships among the dimensions defined by these constructs and student academic performance using principal component analysis, clustering patterns, and regression and correlation analyses. The results indicate that the logical-mathematical intelligence, intrinsic motivation, and self-regulation have a positive impact on academic performance. In contrast, anxiety and dependence on external motivation have a negative effect on academic performance. A priori knowledge of the characteristics of a student sample and its likely behavior predicted by the models may provide both students and teachers with an early-awareness alert that can help the teachers in designing enhanced proactive and strategic decisions aimed to improve academic performance and reduce dropout rates. From the student side, knowledge about their main academic profile will sharpen their metacognition, which may improve their academic performance. },

Selecting students from comprehensive universities in China as research subjects, this study employs surveys and interviews to investigate differences in curriculum content, teaching methods, and educational goals between the two educational models. Popular music education has gained recognition in higher education for its flexibility and innovation, while traditional music education is renowned for its cultural depth and technical rigor. Through comparative analysis, this study reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each method in cultivating students’ creativity, technical skills, cultural inclusivity, and critical thinking.The research adopts Gardner’ s multiple intelligences theory, focusing on creativity, technical skills, emotional expression, social abilities, and cultural identity as core indicators.Results show that popular music education enhances creativity and social engagement, while traditional music education excels in developing technical skills and cultural appreciation.The study proposes integrating both approaches through course design, modern music technology, and diverse evaluation methods to foster students’ multidimensional growth. This integration offers educators new perspectives and tools, emphasizing the importance of technical training and creative development in music education. Unlike previous studies focusing on a single educational model, this research provides practical strategies for advancing music education innovation and development. },

  abstract={ In our everyday lives, we view it as a matter of course that different people are good at different things. It can be surprising, in this context, to learn that most of what is known about cognitive ability variation across individuals concerns the broadest of all cognitive abilities; an ability referred to as general intelligence, general mental ability, or just g. In contrast, our knowledge of specific abilities, those that correlate little with g, is severely constrained. Here, we draw upon our experience investigating an exceptionally specific ability, face recognition, to make the case that many specific abilities could easily have been missed. In making this case, we derive key insights from earlier false starts in the measurement of face recognition's variation across individuals, and we highlight the convergence of factors that enabled the recent discovery that this variation is specific. We propose that the case of face recognition ability illustrates a set of tools and perspectives that could accelerate fruitful work on specific cognitive abilities. By revealing relatively independent dimensions of human ability, such work would enhance our capacity to understand the uniqueness of individual minds. },

To determine the effects of the social competence program, 36 6-year-olds were recruited by using the convenience sampling method. A quasi-experimental study design was employed, in which the experimental group (n=18) participated in the weekly social competence program based on ‘Teaching for Understanding’ for 15 weeks, and the control group (n=18) participated in regular activities provided by the NURI curriculum. We measured social skills, self-esteem, multiple intelligences, and performance for children using the K-SSRS (Korean-Social Skill Rating Scale), the Self-Esteem Scale for Children, the Multiple Intelligence Scale for Children, and the KPS (Korean Project Spectrum). We analyzed data using an ANCOVA to examine the effects of the program based on study variables. The results were as follows; a. The social competence program based on ‘Teaching for Understanding’ developed through the study included “Understanding of myself and others,” “Understanding of socio-culture,” and “Understanding of social roles.” b. There were statistically significant effects of the two groups, indicating a greater increase of sociability, self-esteem, social intelligence, and social performance scores in the experimental group compared to the control group. },

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects on socio-emotional competencies of a physical education intervention (i.e., the MooN program) based on the instructional model known as the sports education model (SEM), compared to a physical education intervention based on the traditional model of direct instruction (TM-DI) in preadolescents. The sample consisted of 170 students between 10 and 13 years old (mean age: M = 10.76; standard deviation: SD = 0.73). Participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (SEM; n = 87) and the active control group (TM-DI; n = 83). In the experimental group, the SEM-based intervention was applied, while in the active control group, an intervention based on the TM-DI was developed. A quasi-experimental design with repeated pre-test and post-test measures and an active control group was used. The self-efficacy inventory for multiple intelligences (IAMI-40) was used to assess the children's socio-emotional competencies. The child perfectionism inventory was applied to evaluate the self-demand perfectionist efforts. The results confirmed that the MooN program (SEM intervention) promoted significant improvements in socio-emotional competencies. These findings support the potential of this physical education instructional model as an emotional education pathway for the socio-emotional improvement of preadolescent students. },

  abstract={ The innovative application of Crowd Intelligent Devices (CIDS) in edge networks has garnered attention due to the rapid development of artificial intelligence and computer technology. This application offers users more reliable and low-latency computing services through computation offloading technology. However, the dynamic nature of network terminals and the limited coverage of edge servers pose challenges, such as data loss and service interruption. Furthermore, the high-speed mobility of intelligent terminals in the dynamic edge network environment further complicates the design of computation offloading and service migration strategies. To address these challenges, this paper explores the computation offloading model of cluster intelligence collaboration in a heterogeneous network environment. This model involves multiple intelligences collaborating to provide computation offloading services for terminals. To accommodate various roles, a switching strategy of split-cluster group collaboration is introduced, assigning the cluster head, the alternate cluster head, and the ordinary user are assigned to a group with different functions. Additionally, the paper formulates the optimal offloading strategy for group smart terminals as a Markov decision process, taking into account factors such as user mobility, service delay, service accuracy, and migration cost. To implement this strategy, the paper utilizes the deep reinforcement learning-based CCSMS algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed edge network service migration strategy, rooted in groupwise cluster collaboration, effectively mitigates interruption delay and enhances service migration efficiency. },

Given the fact that high abilities are most successfully identified and properly developed in early school age, the aim of the study is to investigate the existence of gender differences in the perception of different abilities in boys and girls by teachers, parents, peers and self-perception in multiple intelligences. The research was conducted on 115 lower primary school students in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine differences in various domains of giftedness between girls and boys throughout groups of evaluators. Statistically significant difference was found in 11 of the 36 variables analysed. Most statistically significant differences were found in parents' assessments (5), while 3 were found in teachers' assessments, 2 in peers' assessments, and only one in self-assessments. Although the cultural factors, customs and traditions of the Balkan country of Bosnia and Herzegovina have a great influence on gender stereotypes, the results of research on gender discrimination in the process of identifying giftedness are largely similar to the results of developed European countries. The results of the study can be used in the context of general education as a basis for critical re-examination of negative attitudes towards females in the direction of a particular professional orientation. },

  abstract={ Intelligence is a psychological attribute that has been related to academic performance (Ayoub et al., 2022) and creativity in university students (S & aacute;nchez-Cid et al., 2018). In this sense, Dweck et al. (1995) remarked the importance of self-theories or self-perception about one's own intellectual capacity and the belief of whether it can be modifiable, for the achievement and academic success in higher education students. According to Sternberg (1985) theories explaining intelligence have been organized into two categories: implicit and explicit. Implicit theories refer to particular and personal beliefs based on experience and explicit theories emphasize the biological component and the conception of multiple intelligences. In other words, implicit theories of intelligence constitute a self-perception about one's own intellectual capacities. In this regard, studies have demonstrated their importance in the educational field, as they are related to motivation, academic performance and general well-being; however, despite the fact that empirical evidence has demonstrated the importance of implicit theories of optimal omegas coefficients (TE, omega = .786; TI, omega = .741); in addition, the measure showed temporal stability in its scores after two weeks with respect to the first application (CCI = .751 for TE and CCI = .761 for TI).

The present research involved the design of a STEAM contest that focuses on having students use hand tools to produce three miniature models in the morning and then use these models to compete in relay races and tug-of-war contests in the afternoon. They were required to rely on their intelligence practice without the assistance of teachers or parents. Thus, this research aimed to explore the correlates between students' object-free (bodily-kinesthetic, spatial, logical) and object-related (naturalistic) intelligences, and their hands-on making self-efficacy (HMSE) reflected in their attitude toward quality improvement (ATQI) when participating in a STEAM contest. Data were collected from 330 junior high school students on the day of the STEAM competition and were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the students' 4 types of multiple intelligences were positively related to HMSE. Consequently, HMSE was positively related to ATQI. The results imply that ATQI was essential for students to win in the STEAM contest, which benefited those students with a high level of the 4 types of intelligence mediated by HMSE. },

  abstract={ This article features uncertainty as one of the dominant challenges facing society and, therefore, contemporary public relations. In looking for ways to better adapt and promote public relations to the service of fully functioning society, it revisits controversies around the notion of multiple intelligences (MIs), including emotional intelligence. It examines the stakes and status involved in claiming ownership of IQ or of promoting another form of intelligence(s). In addition, the article foregrounds the formative role played by promotional communication, especially in framing ideas and telling stories, to gain traction in academic communities and to gain acceptance among wider publics. Finally, it suggests that public relations is a disciple of strategic intelligence that could learn by adapting to, or adopting from, the growing range of subjects aspiring to be the next big intelligence. We suggest that such an adaptation has benefits: it might to better access knowledge with contemporary and future relevance rather than slowly consolidating a more insular Public Relations Body of Knowledge based on past results; it can improve the field's impact and reputation by engaging public relations with cross-disciplinary controversies; and it can follow Gardner's (2008) forward-looking view of the need for any discipline, or cluster of good intelligences, to be oriented to serving a global community.

  abstract={ Objectives This study aims to compare the effectiveness of the layered curriculum method (LCM) and project-based learning method (PBLM), on dental students in the evaluation of cysts and tumors affecting the jaws and surrounding tissues, which have an important place in dental practice. Methods Forty-nine 3rd-year dental students who agreed to participate in the study voluntarily were randomly divided into two groups: LCM and PBLM. Pre-test was administered to all students. Students in the PBLM group were divided into five groups and each group was asked to complete a project within a 5-week period and present it to their groupmates at the end of the period. Students in the LCM group were asked to choose the activities most suitable for their learning styles at each layer and to progress by being evaluated by educators in brief interviews throughout the learning process. At the end of the 5-week training period, a post-test and a post-participation questionnaire were administered to students in both groups to obtain feedback. The pre-test and post-test results of the groups and their answers to the post-participation questionnaire were analyzed statistically. Results Post-test results were statistically higher than pre-test results in both LCM and PBLM groups (p < 0.001). When the LCM and PBLM groups were compared, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of pre-test and post-test results (p > 0.05). Conclusion Both PBLM and LCM positively contributed to pre-graduate dental education by enhancing students' academic achievements. Students in both groups stated that their research skills, study habits, and learning motivation increased. Since both models adopt the theory of multiple intelligences, similar methods are recommended for inclusion in dental education. },

  abstract={ Purpose: The purpose of this study is to develop a multiple intelligence scale based on adaptive behaviors for high school students with intellectual disabilities and to propose psychometric adequacy. Methods: Based on the operational definition of multiple intelligence scale based on adaptive behaviors, the study developed a question based on it. Six of the eight multiple intelligences were able to measure language intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. A total of 75 items were developed. For this purpose, a multi - intelligence scale based on adaptive behaviors developed for 343 students with disabilities participating in vocational education programs in integrated vocational education and training schools across the country was conducted. Results: (1) The degree of difficulty and discrimination of the items of the multiple intelligence scale based on adaptive behaviors were judged as appropriate overall. (2) The internal coherence factor by intelligence was .738 ~ .826, and the coefficient of overall scale was .957. (3) As result of Confirmatory Factor Analysis, the relative model fit indices, NFI, RFI, IFI, TLI, and CFI, ranged from .941 to .978, and the absolute model fit index, RMSEA, was very good at .059. Conclusion: The results showed that the multiple intelligence scale based on adaptive behaviors could be used as a useful tool for evaluating and educating high school students with intellectual disabilities. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship among medical students’ learning motivation, characteristics of multiple intelligence, and academic achievement. The participants were 144 medical students. The data were collected by administering learning motivation tests (self-confidence, self-efficacy, level of task, emotion of learning, learning behavior, failure tolerance, task difficulty, and academic self-efficacy), a multiple intelligence test (linguistic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, musical intelligence, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence,spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, and naturalistic intelligence),and two semesters of grades. There is a correlation between multiple intelligences and learning motivation.Among academic self-efficacy of academic motivation, the self-control efficacy (0.28) and behavior (0.18) subscales are significantly positively correlated with academic achievement. However, the emotion subscale (-0.18)was significantly negatively correlated. Learning motivation was correlated with two of the eight multiple intelligence profiles: the intrapersonal intelligence (0.18) and bodily-kinesthetic intelligence (-0.19). The structural equation modeling analysis showed that the behavior and self-control efficacy subscales of intrapersonal intelligence had an impact on academic achievement. An analysis according to the academic achievement group showed significant differences in self-control efficacy and emotion subscales with intrapersonal intelligence. A positive relationship can be observed between learning motivation and some characteristics of multiple intelligence of medical school students. In light of the findings, it is worth examining whether we can control medical students’ learning motivation through educational programs targeting self-control efficacy and intrapersonal intelligence. },

Structural equation models showed that TA was largely a function of Neuroticism, and that CSE and SAI do not contribute to the prediction of TA over established personality traits. Furthermore, the relationship between CSE and TA was fully accounted for by personality traits, whereas SAI was not a significant predictor of TA. The results undermine the notion that self-beliefs affect TA and suggest that wider dispositions play a salient role determining individual differences in TA.

  abstract={ This study is part of a programmatic research effort into the determinants of self-assessed abilities. It examined cross-cultural differences in beliefs about intelligence and self-and other-estimated intelligence in two countries at extreme ends of the European continent. In all, 172 British and 272 Turkish students completed a three-part questionnaire where they estimated their parents', partners' and own multiple intelligences (Gardner (10) and Sternberg (3)). They also completed a measure of the 'big five' personality scales and rated six questions about intelligence. The British sample had more experience with IQ tests than the Turks. The majority of participants in both groups did not believe in sex differences in intelligence but did think there were race differences. They also believed that intelligence was primarily inherited. Participants rated their social and emotional intelligence highly (around one standard deviation above the norm). Results suggested that there were more cultural than sex differences in all the ratings, with various interactions mainly due to the British sample differentiating more between the sexes than the Turks. Males rated their overall, verbal, logical, spatial, creative and practical intelligence higher than females. Turks rated their musical, body-kinesthetic, interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence as well as existential, naturalistic, emotional, creative, and practical intelligence higher than the British. There was evidence of participants rating their fathers' intelligence on most factors higher than their mothers'. Factor analysis of the ten Gardner intelligences yield two clear factors: cognitive and social intelligence. The first factor was impacted by sex but not culture; it was the other way round for the second factor. Regressions showed that five factors predicted overall estimates: sex (male), age (older), test experience (has done tests), extraversion (strong) and openness (strong). Results are discussed in terms of the growing literature in the field. },

  abstract={ Generally, the intelligence and the intuition in Bergson tend to be interpreted with a dichotomous framework; the former is a practical perspective, while the latter is a pure contemplation. This approach, despite its advantages to explain their opposition, can make obscure their rapport. But if the intuition is without any connection with rationality, the science should be excluded from the philosophical thought, and the philosophy of intuition can be reduced to a mere irrationalism. Besides, in this condition, it becomes difficult to recognize the benefit of philosophy, since the intuition is simply characterized by a disinterested knowledge in its opposition to practical intelligence. Therefore, as a complementary perspective, it is necessary to examine the relationship between intuition and intelligence. In fact, Bergson's philosophy assigns a metaphysical status to the science, and his concept of intuition is not simply a pure speculation but also an acting thing; the intelligence actually engages in philosophical thinking, and the intuition has an impact on our daily lives. Thus, Bergson’s philosophy of intuition has nothing to do with a refusal of intellectuality; its goal is just to get a new habit of using the intelligence without intellectualism. From this approach, the possibility of rethinking the priority of image over concept is open to us; concept is more important than image, and the philosophy of intuition can be understood as a progressive intellectual cooperation, that is, a continuous process of superposition of multiple intelligences. },

For that reason, the article reviews several studies performed by the time of the investigation based on the national and international background knowledge. The following topics are discussed: pedagogic musical practice, musical education and school curriculum, music and Down' syndrome, multiple intelligence and integral development, art expression and human development, rights and art expression, and Human Rights for disabled people. The objective of this study is to compare and contrast those subjects, allowing the linking of Human Rights to musical education and its practice in disable people or not, with the objective of sharing the results with people interested in this area. As part of the conclusions this search shows that in Costa Rica there are no jobs related to Human Rights and musical education for Children and Adolescents, and most music works are focused on the multiple intelligences. },

  abstract={ When designing with young children, designers usually select user centred design methods based on the children's required level of engagement and the inspiration expected to be created according to the designer. User centred design methods should be selected for their suitability for children and for the quality of the output of the design method. To understand the suitability of design methods, a framework was developed to describe design methods in terms of required design skills as identified by the Theory of Multiple Intelligences. The proposed framework could provide the basis for a tool to compare design methods and to generate hypotheses about what design method would work optimally with children in a specific school grade. The initial examination of the viability of the framework is a comparison of design methods by the number of skills involved; earlier work showed that the involvement of more skills (as with, e.g. low-fi prototyping) could result in more options for a design problem than the involvement of fewer skills (as with e.g. brainstorming). Options and Criteria were counted to understand the quality of the method in terms of the amount of design-information. The results of the current paper indicate that 8-to-10-year-old children generate significantly more options in prototyping sessions than when they are involved in sessions applying a Nominal Group Technique. The paper indicates that (a) with the framework we can generate hypotheses to compare design methods with children and (b) that the outcome of various design methods, which might lead to very different representations, can be compared in terms of Options and Criteria. Further usage of the framework is expected to result in empirical support for selecting a design method to be applied with young children. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. },

From mixed research methods, the study used an explanatory design. It was conducted with 68 gifted and 144 non-gifted students who were in the 5th, 6th and 7th grades and 5 mathematics teachers. A mathematics achievement test, the Multiple Intelligences Inventory, and a teachers' opinion form were used as the data collection instruments. When the lessons that were designed according to the recently developed differentiation approach were compared with the lessons that were conducted according to the Ministry of National Education curriculum, those lessons designed according to the Purdue model, and those that were conducted within the scope of differentiation that was outlined in the Program for Noticing Individual Skills, the participating students' achievements increased significantly with the use of the recently developed differentiation approach. In addition, the teachers expressed that the activities that were conducted based on the differentiation approach were creative, beneficial, and tailored to the students' levels, and they addressed different intelligences types. The teachers reported that the students were more active; the lessons were more effective; the students improved their academic and social skills; and they had opportunities to understand their students better; understand the importance of project studies; and experience the project management process. },

  abstract={ This study presents the Chinese adaptation of the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI), an instrument for measuring individual differences in musical ability and skilled musical behaviour. Its psychometric properties were examined with a Taiwanese sample. The Gold-MSI inventory was translated into Chinese following recommendations from the literature on cross-cultural test development. Subsequently, the psychometric properties of the Chinese Gold-MSI self-report inventory, including the Melody Memory Task and the Beat Alignment Perception Task, were evaluated using an online survey with 1,065 participants. Results of confirmatory factor analysis suggest that the original factor structure of the Gold-MSI inventory showed an acceptable fit with the data from the Chinese-speaking sample. In addition, the Chinese Gold-MSI inventory shows good reliability. The Melody Memory Task and the Beat Alignment Perception Task also have sufficient test-retest reliability. Finally, correlations between the Chinese Gold-MSI inventory and the Musical-Rhythmic Intelligence subscale of the Eight Multiple Intelligences Questionnaire as well as the two additional music tests provide evidence for convergent and divergent validity. Overall, the data suggest that the Chinese Gold-MSI has good psychometric properties. Percentile norms for the Gold-MSI inventory and the music tests from the present sample are reported for use in future studies. The present study thus makes a valuable contribution to cross-cultural research in music psychology by enabling the comparison between Chinese and Western studies of individual differences in musical ability. },

  abstract={ Preschool teacher training and development addresses the multiplicity of domains and competence areas important in the general development of young children. The psychological, physical and pedagogical aspects of holistic capabilities of preschool teachers have been discussed in this study carried out in China. The research utilized the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) as well as a quantitative approach in collecting information from 325 preschool teachers located in different regions. Consequently, it is clear that there are significant relationships among the competences: psychological competences like stress management and emotional intelligence have an acceptable influence on educational and physical competences as well. Teachers' energy levels and physical health greatly affect their efficiency at teaching their pupils. These results emphasize the importance of an integrated approach to pedagogical development involving professional, emotional and psychical training for better instruction provision. This paper also underlines correlations between various capabilities, which is congruent with Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences and Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory. Some suggestions include creating inclusive teacher education programs; developing inspiring work settings; starting health initiative programs among others. Hence policy decision makers can understand that massive needs have to be met by facilitating holistic programmatic growths whilst rewarding continuous professional development in academics field. This study provides imperative insights into the diverse responsibilities of preschool teachers and lays the groundwork for future research probing longitudinal consequences and objective measures of teacher competence, despite its reliance on self-report data and a narrow geographic emphasis. },

  abstract={ One hundred and ninety-three Hong Kong parents (mean age 42.2 years) were given a structured interview/questionnaire concerning their own and their children's self-estimated overall and multiple intelligence. Previous research suggested that males tend to give higher overall g estimates to their children and themselves than do females, as well as higher scores on mathematical and spatial intelligence (Furnham, 2001). Further, studies in the West suggest that parents think their children are significantly brighter than they are and that their sons are brighter than their daughters. Estimates were lower than those found in Western populations but, even so, males rated their own mathematical and spatial intelligence higher than did females. Hong Kong Chinese parents did not think their sons were brighter than their daughters. The seven multiple intelligences factored into three clear factors for self and children, and regressions indicated that it was academic intelligence (verbal, mathematical, spatial) that was most g loaded. The child's age and the self-rated overall IQ of both the parents were the best predictors of the child's overall estimated IQ. Less than a third of the parents had taken an IQ test or believed they measured IQ very well. Those who were more likely to be better educated, had taken an IQ test, and believed intelligence was inherited were more likely to award themselves higher overall IQ scores. Results are compared with the British studies in the same area. },

For this, self-competence test and learning adjustment test were conducted on elementary school students. The highest intelligence among the 9 multiple intelligences was classified as strength intelligence. This researcher compared and analyzed learning behavior strategies among strength intelligence groups. The results of this study are as follows.First, in the elementary school development stage, most of students have the strength of human-friendly intelligence. Therefore, it can be said that sociality is particularly developed in elementary schools.Second, there were significant differences in music intelligence, language intelligence, spatial intelligence, and human-friendly intelligence development, which differed according to gender. Therefore, it was found that different learning strategies were needed according to gender and strength intelligence.Third, there is a significant difference in gender, grade level, and strength intelligence in writing, reading, concentration, and time management learning behavior strategies except 'learning environment' among learning behavior strategies.Fourth, female students were higher in the order of human-friendly, self-reflection, and music intelligence than males ones. Male students showed higher average of physical exercise and human-friendly intelligence. Female students had lower average physical activity intelligence, male students had lower average music and language intelligence. However, since the impact of language and music strength on learning and behavioral strategies are very high, it will be necessary to educate male students language and music intelligence. },

  abstract={ Hagfish slime threads are an interesting intermediate filament (IF) system in that, in contrast to hair, they appear to be a series system of IFs, consisting of rods and terminal domains (TDs), without matrix. The protein composition also differs from hair. Published data show that the wet stress-strain curve consists of four regions: I, increasing low modulus; 11, plateau; III increasing higher modulus; IV decreasing modulus to break. Beyond 34% extension, there is plastic deformation, which contrasts with the elastic deformation of most biological fibres. The paper considers two explanations, one published by Fudge et al. [D.S. Fudge, K.H. Gardner, V.T. Forsyth, C. Riekel, J.M. Gosline, Biophys. J. 85 (2003) 2015] and one new, of deformation in the four regions. The former regards the TDs as elastic, entropic coils, which extend in region I. The latter regards the TDs as having a plastic, energy-dependent extension in regions III and IV, which is comparable to the drawing of polyester fibres. A rough theoretical model of jumps over energy barriers gives a similar prediction. Twist is suggested as a mechanism for overall thread cohesion. Experimental and theoretical ways forward to a greater understanding of the structural mechanics of hagfish threads are suggested. The behaviour of the total thread/mucus/water system is discussed and some speculations on the defensive mechanisms that have evolved are presented. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. },

  abstract={ Although learning styles (LS) have been recognised as a neuromyth, they remain a virtual truism within education. A point of concern is that the term LS has been used within theories that describe them using completely different notions and categorisations. This is the first empirical study to investigate education professionals' conceptualisation, as well as means of identifying and implementing LS in their classroom. A sample of 123 education professionals were administered a questionnaire consisting both closed- and open-ended questions. Responses were analysed using thematic analysis. LS were found to be mainly conceptualised within the Visual-Auditory-(Reading)-Kinaesthetic (VAK/VARK) framework, as well as Gardner's multiple intelligences. Moreover, a lot of education professionals confused theories of learning (e.g., behavioural or cognitive theories) with LS. In terms of identifying LS, educators reported using a variety of methods, spanning from observation and everyday contact to the use of tests. The ways LS were implemented in the classroom were numerous, comprising various teaching aids, participatory techniques and motor activities. Overall, we argue that the extended use of the term LS gives the illusion of a consensus amongst educators, when a closer examination reveals that the term LS is conceptualised, identified and implemented idiosyncratically by different individuals. This study aims to be of use to pre-service and in-service teacher educators in their effort to debunk the neuromyth of LS and replace it with evidence-based practices. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to do research on correlation between multiple intelligence and e-Learning strategy, which can be used to develop and strengthen e-Learning strategy. The subject was 183 college students of engineering at C university who had ever taken a lesson through e-Learning. Two items are investigated in these college students. One is whether there is a gap and any gender-related difference in multiple intelligence and e-Learning strategy, and the other is what multiple intelligences have an effect on e-Learning strategy. The e-Learning strategy developed by In-Sook Lee and the instrument by Yong-Lin Moon were used. The results of this study are as follows. First, it appeared that there was a difference between gender in musical intelligence and naturalistic intelligence. The average of musical intelligence was higher in female collegian, while the average of naturalistic intelligence was higher in male collegian. But there was no gender-related difference in using e-Learning strategy. Second, it appeared that multiple intelligence gave an explanation of self-direction intelligence up to 31.1%, expression strategy 20.35%, and information processing strategy 16.6%. The results of this study showed that logical-mathematical intelligence affected all of three e-Learning strategies. So, new curriculum which can make use of logical-mathematical intelligence needs to be developed so as to devise efficient e-Learning strategies. },

Arts-Based Research appeared in 1993, driven by Elliot Eisner, as an intensification of the aesthetic qualities of educational research processes and outcomes. It has developed bringing human and social sciences research closer to artistic creation (despite epistemological positions, such as those of H. Gardner, which bluntly separate the arts from science). Its fundamental characteristic is the use of ideas and forms of representation provided by the arts to do research. One of the methodological modalities of Arts-Based Research is A/r/tography, which appeared in 2003 driven by Rita Irwin, as a coherent and balanced unification of artistic, educational and research purposes. Its fundamental methodological concepts are vital inquiry, metaphors and metonymies, reverberations and the search for meaning in the combination of texts and images. Both Arts-Based Research and A/r/tography used any artistic specialty (dance, literature, music, theatre, visual arts, etc.), therefore become the meeting one between qualitative methodological innovations in human and social sciences, and the community based and participatory trends of contemporary art, such as 'Artivism'. },

The purpose of this paper is to share initial findings on assessment of systems thinking competency.Design/methodology/approach - The 15-week course served 14 mostly third and fourth-year students. Assessment of learning arose through one short answer exam, one interactive small group dialogue exam, homework assignments, completion of an online community engagement tutorial, and completion of a final reflective project (either in a group or individual).Findings - The range of assessments enabled the authors to provide frequent and ongoing feedback, a long time horizon for learning, and stable communities of practice. Students had multiple opportunities to demonstrate their learning progress in a variety of forms and contexts across multiple intelligences.Research limitations/implications - Despite attempts to actively promote the kind of frequent and authentic assessment advocated in the literature, the authors' results suggest the need for a consistent and valid assessment measure with an agreed upon rubric and stable assessment across multiple reviewers.Practical implications - The authors recommend that the proper activities and rubrics exist to match a program's competencies before implementing the approach.Social implications - The examples described in the paper provide some concrete assignments and approaches linked to the pedagogy of teaching and learning amenable to many other educational institutions in support of the UN Education for Sustainable Development effort.Originality/value - The authors' approach provides a unique attempt at implementing and assessing a competency-based approach to implementing the learning paradigm to foster sustainability systems thinking. },

  abstract={ This study investigated sex differences in estimated general and multiple intelligence in school children, their parents, and their teachers. There were three groups of participants: 285 (149 female, 136 male) pupils of a mixed government-run comprehensive school, between the ages of 13 and 16 years; 93 mothers and 58 fathers of the pupils; and five female and eight male teachers. Children estimated their own and their parents' IQ, whilst the parents estimated their own and their children's IQ; the teachers estimated only the children's intelligence. The aims of this study were firstly to assess whether perceptions of male intellectual superiority were observable in school age children and school teachers, and to make direct comparisons between the children's self-estimations and those of the parents and the teachers. Secondly, this study aimed to replicate previous literature on adult self-estimations of overall and multiple intelligences, and to compare these to estimations by children of these adults (their parents). Fewer sex differences were observed than expected. Teachers' estimations did not follow conceptions of male superiority. The patterns of sex differences in mother and teacher estimations of children were similar to each other, as were those of fathers and children. Verbal and numerical abilities were found to be most closely related to estimations of overall IQ in all three groups. Most striking was the lack of correlation between father and daughter estimations of each other. Reasons why this study failed to replicate findings on adult samples are discussed.

The research findings were as follows: First, the low achievers of the experiment group that received strengths-based instruction based on the multiple intelligence theory showed a bigger increase in learning flow from the pre-test scores to the post-test scores than the comparison group that received no such instruction, thus improving in learning flow. Second, the low achievers of the experiment group that received strengths-based instruction based on the multiple intelligence theory showed a bigger increase in achievement motivation from the pre-test scores to the post-test scores than the comparison group that received no such instruction, thus improving in achievement motivation. Finally, the low achievers of the experiment group that received strengths-based instruction based on the multiple intelligence theory showed a bigger increase in self-efficacy from the pre-test scores to the post-test scores than the comparison group that received no such instruction, thus improving in self-efficacy. Those findings demonstrate that strengths-based instruction is an effective teaching method to help low achievers improve their learning flow, achievement motivation, and self-efficacy. },

  abstract={ Identification the diverse strong and weak abilities of preschoolers and then fostering their individual capabilities are very important tasks in early education. Though it is so important, it is also difficult because identification of ability is really not easy. In this reason, Lee (2007) developed a measuring instrument for identification the talent and characteristics of preschoolers which have validity and reliability as a 1st step of this study and as 2nd step, I developed MI program for fostering multiple intelligences of preschoolers based on the MI theory in this study.According to the previous studies (Gardner, 1983, 1990, 1993; Shearer, 1994) of multiple intelligence, human intelligence is divided 7 or 9 domains, linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, musical, body-kinesthetic, natural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal. And intellectual traits might be related with cultural and social condition. However, according to the results of Lee (2007), I included 5 domains of intelligence, linguistic, logical-mathematical/spatial, musical/body-kinesthetic, and natural, inter-intrapersonal, to make the capability development program for preschoolers. In this study, I suggested MI Model to constructed Capability Development Program for Preschooler. This program was developed on the basis of the theory of MI of children who were 3 years old to 5 years old. After developing the program, I identified the effectiveness of the program in improving the multiple intellectual abilities. Therefore, it is hoped that the MI program for young children developed in this study will be utilized a선s an education program that enhances young children's multiple intelligence in the education field. },

  abstract={ The computer-assisted learning is a very modern study area, which can be applied to the learning process. The main objective of this paper is to present a software system for online learning based on the intelligent software agents technologies. The main ideas on which this paper is built are: to any person is associated a learning profile (the idea is based on the existence of multiple intelligences, defined by Gardner [3]); the pedagogical resources can be shaped through educational semantic networks or through conceptual maps; a flexible software system in computer assisted learning must be based on the intelligent agents' technology. The system dedicated to computer-assisted learning must be adapted to the learning profile of each student.The author presents a flexible online teaching software system, which learns to teach according to the learning profile of each student (the author defines this system in the PhD thesis and includes: intelligent agent structures, reward learning algorithms, algorithms to generate plans for an agent).The application includes two agents: the supervising agent and the pedagogical agent, which determines the optimal pedagogical resources for teaching the course. The application has been designed in Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 and uses Microsoft Agent Technology, which allows vocal recognition. Also, the Proteje 3.0 software has been used, software that allows building ontology for computer assisted learning. The system has been experimented on the Graph Theory Course, taught at postuniversitary computer science courses, the results proving the necessity of defining a strategy for selecting the pedagogical resources presented to the students according to their learning profile. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study was to examine the naturalist intelligence based on project spectrum of Multiple Intelligences. This program is both curriculum and evaluation, and it's meant to investigate the way of applying and performing it among teachers in an attempt to improve their instruction. The participants were nine early childhood teachers, and this study was implemented during a 10-week period of time. The findings of the study were as follows: The project spectrum that focused on naturalist intelligence domain was performed in the following procedure: encounter, the first application(difficulties in the application of the program and reflective examination), the second application(diverse attempts), the third application(enrichment), the fourth application(the development of strength through the project spectrum), and overall discussion/evaluation in pursuit of sustainability and a better future). Second, the meaning of the performance of the program was analyzed. As for its meaning as a program, it's found that the nature- friendly project spectrum could serve as a tool to evaluate the nature- friendly domain linked to families, as a tool to develop the strength of preschoolers and as a tool of scaffolding. Regarding its meaning for the teachers, that was viewed as a means of colleague supervision and self-supervision. The findings of the study suggest that the spontaneous performance of the project spectrum makes it possible to step up the growth of the program itself as a program, to ensure successful supervision and to facilitate the reflective thinking and growth of teachers. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study is to explore the philosophical and theoretical foundations of differentiated instruction(DI). Students’ individual differences have intrigued and challenged Korean educators since the announcement of 5․31 educational reform in 1995. The DI is an approach to planning so that one lesson is taught to the entire class while meeting the individual needs of each student. The key to a DI is that all students are regularly offered choices and matched with tasks compatible with their individual learning profiles. Although the understanding and application of this concept motivates many educators, practical responses to individual differences except learning pace have almost entirely eluded them. Teachers want to create multiple paths so that students of different abilities, interest or learning needs experience equally appropriate ways to absorb, use, develop and present concepts as a part of the daily learning process. However, they are afraid of implementing DI due to the lack of background information.The best practice is usually rooted in learning theories that are supported by a sound philosophy the main society has. This study deals with the foundations of DI. The concept of DI is addressed first, followed by philosophical, psychological, and historical foundations. DI is supported by the progressive philosophy in which individual differences are recognized. DI is also substantiated by th constructivist psychological theories such as Piaget's theory of 'genetic epistemology' and Vygotsky's theory of 'social development', and also Gardner's multiple intelligences theory. Educational innovations in which ideas and practices were close to those of DI are examined. },

Therefore, we shall investigate what directions that system is taking nowadays on three different levels. First, we analyze the role of educational innovation linked to the development of technological applications, which is not only configuring new teaching and learning models, but also business opportunities inspired by the entertainment industry, thus threatening the continuity of the educational system and as we know it today. Secondly, we examine the pedagogical approach to competencies that, beyond promoting changes in school culture, favors the development of a pragmatic and economic vision of education. Finally, and based on the discourse about competency education and the theory of multiple intelligences, we analyze the role that the promotion of emotional competencies in education is taking from the influence of positive psychology and the happiness industry. The connections between these three levels underline how it contributes to configure the functional subjectivities according to the neoliberal rationality that governs us. Facing these tendencies, it appears necessary to claim the renewal of the pedagogical commitment with the new generations. This commitment has to provide more than only a free election of a formative menu for the professional development or the development of an educational culture interested mainly in the emotional competencies and the promotion of the spirit of entrepreneurship. In opposition to the current pedagogical tendencies that only encourage a model of individualistic and psychological citizenship, we claim - like Hannah Arendt - a pedagogical commitment relating the subject with culture, the desire of knowledge and the opening to a common world. },

There are also consistent generational effects with adult participants believing around a half standard deviation difference in intelligence with their grandparents being least intelligent and children most. Self-estimated and psychometric intelligence only correlates weakly, Studies looking at self and other estimates of multiple intelligence indicated that participants seemed to believe that intelligence was male normative in that it was specifically those types of intelligence (mathematical and spatial) that most differentiated between the sexes that were themselves more predictive of general overall intelligence. Implications of these findings for intelligence testing are considered. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. },

Therefore, in this study, we developed a checklist form that can measure the multiple intelligence of adults and validated it. The preliminary test was developed by Armstrong (1994), which verified the content validity of five experts after completing the adult multiple intelligence measurement tool and developed 80 items (10 items for each of 8 areas). The participants were 444 college students. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS WIN 23.0 and AMOS WIN 22.0 programs. In order to verify the validity of the measurement tools, the sample appropriateness of KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) was verified and the Bartlett's sphere formation test was conducted to determine the suitability of the sample and to calculate the fitness index. The exploratory factor analysis was performed by Principal Component Analysis and the maximum likelihood method was used for confirmatory factor analysis. For the confirmatory factor analysis, the fitness index such as CFI, NFI, IFI, RMSEA was used. The results of this study are as follows. First, the reliability of the multiple intelligence test was found to be .625～833, and the reliability of the total items was .894. The validity of the measurement items for each domain was secured. The reliability and validity of the MI test for adults will be useful in measuring the multiple intelligences of adults and teachers, including gifted students and college students. },

  abstract={ With the continuous development and progress of wireless self-organizing network communication technology, how to carry out long-distance cooperative control of multiple intelligences under the framework of an air-ground integrated wireless high-mobility self-organizing network has become a hot and difficult topic that needs to be solved urgently. This paper takes the air-ground integrated wireless high-mobility self-organizing network system as the basic framework and focuses on solving the long-distance cooperative fault-tolerant control of multi-intelligent bodies and the topological stability of a wireless mobile self-organizing network. To solve the above problems, a direct neural network with a robust adaptive fault-tolerant controller is designed in this paper. By constructing a symmetric population neural network model and combining it with the Lyapunov stabilization criterion, the system feedback matrix K has the ability of autonomous adaptive learning, and symmetrically distorts, rotates, or scales the training data to instantly adjust the system's fault-tolerant corrections and adaptive adjusting factors to resist the unknown disturbances and faults, to achieve the goals of multi-intelligent body stable control and the stable operation of a wireless high-mobility self-organizing network topology. Simulation results show that with the feedback adjustment of the multi-system under the designed controller, the multi-system as a whole has good fault-tolerant performance and autonomous learning approximation performance, and the tracking error asymptotically converges to zero. The experimental results show that the multi-flight subsystems fly stably, the air-ground integrated wireless high-mobility self-organizing network topology has good stability performance, and the maximum relative improvement of the topology stability performance is 50%. },

  abstract={ What role, if any, should emotions play in clinical reasoning and decision making? Traditionally, emotions have been excluded from clinical reasoning and decision making, but with recent advances in cognitive neuropsychology they are now considered an important component of them. Today, cognition is thought to be a set of complex processes relying on multiple types of intelligences. The role of mathematical logic (hypothetico-deductive thinking) or verbal linguistic intelligence in cognition, for example, is well documented and accepted; however, the role of emotional intelligence has received less attention-especially because its nature and function are not well understood. In this paper, I argue for the inclusion of emotions in clinical reasoning and decision making. To that end, developments in contemporary cognitive neuropsychology are initially examined and analyzed, followed by a review of the medical literature discussing the role of emotions in clinical practice. Next, a published clinical case is reconstructed and used to illustrate the recognition and regulation of emotions played during a series of clinical consultations, which resulted in a positive medical outcome. The paper's main thesis is that emotions, particularly in terms of emotional intelligence as a practical form of intelligence, afford clinical practitioners a robust cognitive resource for providing quality medical care. },

  abstract={ Abstract The present document is a continuation of previous documents that start from the same premise: the learning of mathematics is done through the action of moving and not only expecting that the information imparted by a teacher that is expressed orally and writing, will be repeated by the student. It requires a classroom environment in which to motivate, design, elaborate, problematize, summarize and coordinate a game whose theme is done around mathematical contents. However, the main teaching objective is not to create a game but rather that the student know in his own experience a process of innovation and diffusion. In case of materializing his idea he could defend it before an audience and even promote its use, as documented in this work. So far, the public has consisted of students from another institution and the search for spaces is an alternative for its sales. },

  abstract={ In this paper, a trajectory tracking controller based on linear time-varying model prediction is developed, and the model predictive control theory based on the six degrees of freedom dynamic model and tire model is applied. Combined with the soft constraint of turning angle and the control algorithm to ensure the stability, the trajectory tracking is realized. The terminal node is a wearable device. The terminal node is equipped with a pressure sensor and attitude sensor network to collect human data, and then the terminal node sends the data to the ZigBee network. The data in the sensor network will be received by the gateway, and the data will be processed and displayed on the PC software after being received by the gateway. Finally, the data is saved to the remote server for archiving. The application of intelligent learning systems in sports makes up for many shortcomings of traditional sports. The teaching of the course consists of seven types of intelligent courses, which not only conform to the spirit of high-quality education but also combine the shortcomings of traditional physical education learning and combines several intelligent theories and the need for time development. The purpose is to develop a new sports model suitable for students' all-round development. Under the guidance of the theory of intelligent learning system, this paper establishes a new and diverse movement model, including various educational models, educational contents, educational methods, student-based learning model, and multidimensional evaluation. By comparing and analyzing the results of the two groups, the multiple intelligences physical education is more suitable for the development of modern students' various intelligences. According to the physical education learning questionnaire, students also learn more methods and contents and accept diversified teaching evaluation, which expands the development direction of students. },

This interest leads to the interest in the direction of talent education and the multiple intelligence theory is applied as the basis and method for educational changes. The purpose of this study is to identify the differences in multiple intelligence according to the major and multiple intelligence factors which affect the satisfaction and fitness in each major by comparing the multiple intelligences of college students with different majors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted using self-written questionnaire survey method targeting the design and engineering department college students. Study results showed, first, design department college students showed relatively higher scores in intrapersonal intelligence, and engineering department college students showed relatively higher scores in musical intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, visual-spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence.Second, bodily-kinesthetic intelligence and logical-mathematical intelligence were higher in engineering department students and linguistic intelligence was higher in design department students. Third, regarding the satisfaction in the major and fitness with the major, design department students showed positive effects in intrapersonal intelligence and engineering department students showed positive effects in logical-mathematical intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence. Through observation of the multiple intelligence tendency in each major and the differences in multiple intelligence and verification of the effects of the intelligence on the students’ satisfaction and fitness in each major, this study is meaningful in that the student’ intelligence is different by each major and it identified the educational basis as to what dispositions should be more emphasized in an individual major education. },

  abstract={ Differences in sex and culture between Macanese and Portuguese university students in self and parental estimations of IQ were examined using Gardner's ( 1999) list of 10 multiple intelligences. A total of 197 Macanese ( 90 male and 107 female) and 331 Portuguese ( 139 male and 192 female) students participated in the investigation. The following hypotheses were tested: it was anticipated that there would be sex differences in selfrated mathematical and spatial intelligence, with men giving higher self-estimates than women; it was predicted that there would be cultural differences between Macanese and Portuguese, with the former awarding themselves and their parents significantly lower scores than the latter; participants would rate their fathers as more intelligent overall than their mothers; the best predictors of overall ( g) IQ would be logical/ mathematical, spatial, and verbal intelligence. In contrast to previous results ( Furnham, 2001), when examined separately, gender differences in both self-estimates and parents estimates did not occur in the Macanese sample. There were, however, consistent and clear culture differences. Portuguese gave higher self and family ratings than Macanese, as expected. Portuguese rated their verbal, body kinetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic intelligence higher than did Macanese. Portuguese rated verbal, mathematical, spatial, interpersonal, intrapersonal, existential, and naturalistic father's intelligence higher than did Macanese. Portuguese rated verbal, mathematical, spatial, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, existential, spiritual, and naturalistic mother's intelligence higher than did Macanese. Participants of both cultures rated overall intelligence of their father higher than that of their mother. This was also to be expected as previous studies have shown this to be the case in terms of gender stereotyping. In both cultures verbal and interpersonal intelligences predict overall intelligence. However, in Macao, body- kinetic and intrapersonal intelligences, and in Portugal logical and naturalistic intelligences, also predict overall intelligence. Implications of these results for education and self- presentations are considered. },

These postgraduate studies were created in 1996: nowadays, 14 generations have graduated from the Master of Human Resources Development; 13 generations, from the Master of Quality Management; and 8 from the Master in Educational Technology. The instrument used in this research was created by Whiteley and is based on the model of multiple intelligences developed by Gardner and the neuro-linguistic programming model by Bandler and Grinder. The research was conducted with a sample of 72 participants, who represent one hundred percent of the students enrolled. The results showed that the most prevalent learning styles are logical and social, and the auditory and physical learning styles were the less predominant. Consequently, it was able to recommend content, resources and learning activities for each learning style. },

  abstract={ Carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) is a glucose-responsive transcription factor that plays a critical role in the glucose-mediated induction of genes involved in hepatic glycolysis and lipogenesis. Circulating blood glucose levels affect ChREBP activity in hepatocytes largely by post-translational mechanisms that include phosphorylation-dependent subcellular localization. Previously, we showed that ChREBP is retained in the cytosol by phosphorylation-dependent binding to 14-3-3 protein dimers and identified the alpha 2 helix (residues 125-135) phospho-Ser(140) domain as the primary 14-3-3 binding site (Sakiyama, H., Wynn, R. M., Lee, W. R., Fukasawa, M., Mizuguchi, H., Gardner, K. H., Repa, J. J., and Uyeda, K. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 24899-24908). To enter the nucleus in response to high glucose, ChREBP must bind importin-alpha; this heterodimer then forms a complex with importin-beta to interact with the nuclear pore complex. In this work, we recharacterized the importin-alpha binding nuclear localization signal (NLS) of rat ChREBP, identifying it as an extended classical bipartite NLS encompassing minimally residues 158-190. Replacing Lys(159)/Lys(190) residues of ChREBP with alanine resulted in loss of importin-alpha binding, glucose-stimulated transcriptional activity and nuclear localization. Asecondary 14-3-3 protein binding site also was identified, the alpha 3 helix (residues 170-190) phospho-Ser(196) domain. Importin-alpha and 14-3-3 were found to bind competitively to this secondary site. These results suggest an important mechanism by which importin-alpha and 14-3-3 control movement of ChREBP in and out of the nucleus in response to changes in glucose levels in liver and thus further suggest that the extended NLS of ChREBP is a critical glucose-sensing, glucose-responsive site. },

  abstract={ Multiple intelligences, with its hypothesis and implementation, have ascended to a prominent status among the many instructional methodologies. Meanwhile, pedagogical theories and concepts are in need of more alternative and interactive assessments to prove their prevalence (Kinugasa, Yamashita, Hayashi, Tominaga, & Yamasaki, 2005) In general, item templates adopted in current on-line testing system are mostly true and false, multiple choice and multiple selection More sophisticated interactive alternatives such as click and select, drag and drop, link, collide and magnetize are still in great demand. The fact that the lack of template alternatives has made it difficult for the general teachers to incorporate interactive items into testing. To underpin interactive multimedia test, this research has cultivated interactive item template as the basic sharing atomic unit In addition, a corresponding visual item authoring system Interactive Test Item System (ITIS) (Koong et al, 2007), and an auto-grading examer were developed Meanwhile, an item sharing website based on Web2.0 was constructed, through which users can exchange the created interactive item templates. interactive items. and interactive test sheet. The design of on-line visual authoring item editor has made it possible to create items by click and select, drag and drop, link, or parameter setting. Multimedia such as text, image, audio, and animation can be added, deleted or set to the wished animated effect to created into an interactive item, while on-line interactive testing as well as auto-grading are supported.The system was applied to the 5th graders to assess their learning performance on Social Studies Focuses of this research are on investigating: (1) differences between interactive multimedia test and the conventional paper-and-pencil examination, (2) performance of student of different capability with different testing approaches; and (3) testee's opinions toward ITIS. Essential findings are as follows (I) student's performance was consistent either in interactive test or paper-and-pencil examination, signifying capability can be tested through the system Also, little discrimination was shown between two types of testing, (2) better performance was indicated when underachievers were implemented interactive multimedia test. and (3) positive attitudes was shown by students who have taken Interactive multimedia test.

  abstract={ Institutionalized children represent a risk-factor category from the perspective of social integration. Educational interventions implemented in programs designed for children raised in foster homes verify the effectiveness of complex means of training that could influence their multidimensional development. Among these means, dance has been identified as a way of developing coordination, rhythmicity, motor skills, and spatiotemporal orientation through body movements. Starting from the hypothesis that the systematic participation of institutionalized children in a dance program contributes to the development of their motor skills, an intervention model based on dance content was designed for this study. The purpose of this research is to optimize the motor skills of institutionalized children and to stimulate their bodily-kinesthetic and visual-spatial intelligences. The objectives of the study are to highlight the influence of dance on the development of institutionalized children and to develop the methodological concept regarding the use of dance for institutionalized children at the age of preadolescence. The research was conducted over a nine-month period,with a frequency of two training sessions per week of 60 minutes each, and was based on the consolidation of steps from different dance styles for a group of 29 institutionalized children aged 11-12 years. Testing was carried out using the Optojump device, and the tests applied were aimed at assessing their lower limb power, reaction speed, repetition speed, and spatiotemporal orientation. The motor effects produced indicate positive changes in test values, with all results showing significant differences after nine months of participation in the dance program. The greatest impact is for the displacement point of the March in Place Eyes Closed 30 Seconds test, which reveals an improvement in spatial orientation ability. In conclusion, the participation of institutionalized children in a dance program contributes to the optimization of their motor skills and the stimulation of their bodily-kinesthetic and visual-spatial intelligences, therefore we consider it appropriate to deepen the study of dance as a means of developing multiple intelligences through educational programs implemented in schools. },

As suggested by the theory of multiple in-telligences, this study explores how cultural intelligence (CQ) and emotional intelligence (EQ) influence the occurrence of interpersonal, task and process conflicts in GVTs. Furthermore, by drawing on the contingency theory of task conflict and performance in groups and organisational teams, we examine the impact of these different types of conflict on the performance of GVTs. Utilising multilevel analysis, we tested the research model using a sample of 810 graduate and undergraduate business students from 38 different countries who worked in 232 GVTs. The re-sults show that the CQ and EQ of the team members reduce the occurrence of the three different intragroup conflicts in GVTs. We also demonstrate that process conflict negatively affects GVT performance. We discuss the implications for research and practice. },

  abstract={ Introduction: The aim of this study is to reveal the effect of scientific attitude and intelligence on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) motivation using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). It is possible to say that there is a reciprocal relationship between attitudes towards science, intelligence and motivation towards STEM. Motivation is closely and positively related to STEM, scientific attitude, intelligence and organizational development. When female students are supported and motivated positively, it is possible for them to be successful in STEM. It is possible to say that female students are the female leadership candidates of the future. Female leader candidates can play a role in future organizational development. Female leader candidates who are supported and motivated by their environment can take their place in organizational development. There is a gap in the research literature on this subject in Turkiye. This study fills an important gap in terms of sampling, research method and data analysis.Method: In the study, personal information form, Attitude Towards Scientific Research Scale, Multiple Intelligences Self-Perception Scale and STEM Value-Expectation Rating Scale were applied to 159 female undergraduate students who are disadvantaged in STEM field and studying at Ege University Odemis Faculty of Health Sciences.Results: It is possible to say that most female students have positive attitudes towards scientific research. According to the research results, as the reluctance to help researchers and negative attitudes towards research increase, motivation towards STEM decreases. As positive attitudes towards research and researchers increase, motivation towards STEM increases. In addition, increases in verbal-linguistic intelligence, logical-mathematical intelligence, spatial intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence and natural intelligence lead to an increase in positive attitudes towards research and thus STEM motivation.Conclusion: When the value expectations of future female leadership candidates for the STEM field were evaluated, it was found that 81.13% of the students had a medium level of value expectation evaluation level for the STEM field. This situation suggests that female students are not positively motivated for STEM in the family, school and peer environment. },

Of a total of 216 sixth-graders at G Elementary School in Busan, 32 children in lower 15% group with poor results of the school life adjustment test were assigned to experimental and control groups, 16 for each group; then, a total of 20 sessions of the self-growth program based on the multiple intelligence theory were provided only to the experimental group for 90 minutes twice a week, and pretest and post-test for self-respect and adjustment to school life were carried out to examine its influences in both experimental and control groups. Consequently, the self-growth program based on the multi-intelligence theory was effective in improving self-esteem and adjustment to school life for children who showed maladjustment to school life. In other words, the program enabled maladjusted children through understanding of multiple intelligence to discover their latent talents and recognize their own and others' emotion, ultimately regarding themselves as more valuable. As for school life, it positively changed teacher-student and peer relations, instructions and participation in events, and even school environment. },

The research is part of the Cayambe Educational Unit, with the students of the two parallels of the tenth year of basic general education and teachers of the Natural Sciences area, with the main objective of implementing a virtual learning environment (EVA) for the teaching of ecosystems in the area of Natural Sciences in the tenth year students, through an environmental interpretive path with free software, we worked in coordination with the campus authorities to carry out the investigative process. Among the findings, it was evidenced that the traditional model continues to prevail despite the fact that there is a national curriculum with a constructivist approach and currently the stage of connectivity requires a constant search for new strategies using ICT for teaching, under this approach an educational resource was developed in Artsteps to overcome and improve understanding of ecosystems in Ecuador. },

In this study, we found that Clavibacter sp. strain ALA2 produced novel THFAs, including 13,16-dihydroxy-12-THFA, 15epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (13,16-dihydroxy-THFA), and 7,13,16-trihydroxy-12, 15-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (7,13,16-trihydroxy-THFA), from alpha-linolenic acid (9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid). The chemical structures of these products were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. The optimum incubation temperature was 30degreesC for production of both hydroxy-THFAs. 13,16-Dihydroxy-THFA was detected after 2 days of incubation, and the concentration reached 45 mg/50 ml after 7 days of incubation; 7,13,16-trihydroxy-THFA was not detected after 2 days of incubation, but the concentration reached 9 mg/50 ml after 7 days of incubation. The total yield of both 13,16-dihydroxy-THFA and 7,13,16-trihydroxy-THFA was 67% (wt/wt) after 7 days of incubation at 30'C and 200 rpm. In previous studies, it was reported that Clavibacter sp. strain ALA2 oxidized the C-7, C-12, C-13, C-16, and C-17 positions of linoleic acid (n-6) into hydroxy groups. In this case, the bond between the C-16 and C-17 carbon atoms is saturated. In ot-linolenic acid (n-3), however, the bond between the C-16 and C-17 carbon atoms is unsaturated. It seems that enzymes of strain ALA2 oxidized the C-12-C-13 and C-16-C-17 double bonds into dihydroxy groups first and then converted them to hydroxy-THFAs. },

  abstract={ While in college, students have to have opportunities to be educated according to the right career design through the systematic career education and exploration built up during the middle-school and high-school age, which lead to successful employment process. However, In fact, many of the cases today have shown that college students cannot make appropriate decisions on determining school and major mainly due to conditional factors such as highschool GPA and parental pressure. As a result, they tend to have problems in making decisions for their own future career even after college admission. Thus, this study aims primarily to present models of career education program based on the Multiple Intelligence Theory and secondarily to examine the influence of collective counseling programs on career decision making, self-efficacy, and career maturity of collegians through the steps of program development, practice,and evaluation. Of this research program Choi sungsick's ‘systematic program development cycle mode’ is based on.Thirty voluntary research subjects that wanted to participate in the collective counseling programs were selected from “D” university located in Busan, South Korea. The human subjects were randomly assigned to experimental group,control group, and comparative group; and each group consists of ten of them. Experimental group had collective counseling programs based on the Multiple Intelligence Theory, while the comparative group had general career counseling programs. The collected data for the experiment was reported from the one-way ANOVA method of SPSS/WIN (Version 18.0). In order to possibly minimize the shortcomings of quantitative research based on statistical analysis, the research team accumulated the data of specifiable variables by program evaluation surveys, period feedback,idea-sharing, open Q&As, and post-interview. In back of this research, discussed conclusions are as following:Comparison of results and the experimental group and control groups compared to the career decision-making, career self- efficacy and career maturity was confirmed that a significantly rising. Multiple intelligences theory in the present study was conducted based on the career counseling group counseling group than in the normal course of the rational decision making college and career to raise self- efficacy and career maturity was found to be effective. Based on multiple intelligence theory to discover the potential to increase self-understanding, career university that supports setting the course of this program is effective in training are expected to play a role },

  abstract={ Introduction: Since both components critical thinking and moral reasoning are considered to be major phenomena, the development of which is a priority of all world education policies, they are paid a lot of attention in foreign countries. However, foreign studies have only made a little mention of examining their relationship and integrity as well as until recently, each dimension has been examined separately in Slovakia and there is no piece of evidence showing the relationship between them. Based on this, we have formulated the following scientific problem: Is there a relationship between critical thinking and moral reasoning? Methods and respondents: The basic measurement tool of our research was the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal used to determine the level of critical thinking. The level of moral reasoning was investigated by Lind's Moral Competence Test. The examined sample consisted of the available selection of the 2nd and 3rd year teacher study programme students for lower and upper secondary education at the University of Presov in Presov (N = 241) and the testing itself was realized in the academic year 2020/2021. Results: Our research shows that the average value of the gross score in critical thinking of the teacher students is M = 43.26 (SD = 5.09) and the achieved average numeric value of moral judgment expressed by the C-score is M = 21.15 (SD = 12.88). Based on the Pearson Correlation results, we were discussing whether the calculated value of the correlation coefficient indicates the relationship between critical thinking and moral reasoning and whether there is a relationship between moral reasoning and individual cognitive components of critical thinking and the results of the research show interesting findings about the relationship between critical and moral reasoning of teacher students. Conclusion: The conclusions of the research lead us to redesign the undergraduate training of future teachers in the context of the World Economic Forum challenges and the support for minds of the future according to H. Gardner - critical, creative, disciplined, ethical and tolerant - as a critical and moral integrity. },

  abstract={ The purpose of this study was to develop a program based on the multiple intelligence theory to promote children's ability of drawing expression, and to verify and analyze its effects and causes. The program was prepared according to the Arts PROPEL model based on the multiple intelligence theory focusing on the elements of art in order to achieve the objectives. The subjects of this research consisted of 40 five-year-old children(20 in the experimental group and 20 in the comparison group), over 20 times during a 16 week period from May 11, 2012 to August 22, 2012. The multiple intelligence development assessment scale of Shearer(1991) adapted by Kim(2001) and the drawing expression ability measurement of Ji(2001) modified and complemented by Kim(2005) were used as the tools in this study. The collected data were analyzed by the analysis of covariance to verify the effectiveness and the repeated measure analysis of variance to examine the patterns of the drawing expression ability. The intelligence strengths and weaknesses of the children were investigated and the discriminant analysis was used to examine the degree of impact of multiple intelligence on the drawing expression ability and the interrelationships between the multiple intelligence and the drawing expression ability. The results of this study were as follows: First, the art program based on the multiple intelligence theory had a positive impact on the children’s drawing expression ability and also on the knowledge of basic shapes, line merging, various colors, detailed depiction, harmonious configuration, various shapes, representations related to topics, creativity of representation, and the completeness of drawing, which are sub-areas of the drawing expression ability. Second, based on the art program, the total score of the drawing expression ability was continuously increased throughout the 5th to the 15th class and was maintained afterwards. Third, the multiple intelligence was one of the variables to predict the drawing expression ability of children and the result showed that spatial intelligence predicts the ability at the highest degree. This study indicates that the systematic art programs focusing on art elements help children to reconfigure elements through the process of reflective thinking. Also, results show that the element of spatial intelligence is most activated among the intelligences related to the drawing expression in the process of thinking based on the multiple intelligences which helps improve the drawing expression ability. },

Therefore, the main question of this research is generated in what meanings emerge from the lived experience of Elementary General Basic Education (EGB) teachers, regarding the application of neurodidactics as a mechanism for improving the teaching-learning praxis? For which, the main objective was to understand the meanings that emerge from the lived experience of Elementary General Basic Education (EGB) teachers, in relation to what was commented as part of the initial question. In turn, four objectives related to multiple intelligences, methodological and neuroeducational strategies used by the teaching team in their educational praxis were derived. The methodology was based on the qualitative approach, obtaining favorable points in the application of neurodidactics in education, for all ages. As part of the conclusions, it was determined that this new pedagogical tool is at the forefront of education, because it is designed for each learner's ability. Thus, it gives the opportunity to work on the same topics of the curriculum established by the Ministry of Education. },

  abstract={ The purpose of the study is to investigate academic compatibility between the construct of ‘competence’ and the theory of Multiple Intelligence (MI) and to reanalyze the components of MI based on theoretical assumptions, expecting to solve the problems of existing measurement tools for MI. First, the construct of ‘competence’ is consistent with the theory of MI in terms of the facts that (a) the competence concept emphasizes the performance of agents in reality and (b) considers emotional aspects of abilities, and that (c) the potentiality of agents is also as important as the real performance in context for ‘competence.’ Therefore, it can be said that ‘competence’ and the theory of MI is related to each other and are complementary for one another. For example, the assessing methods for MI, which covers as well as emotional aspects of abilities, can be utilized for the assessing methodology for competence, which stresses the performance in contexts. In addition, attempts to measure potentials through performances in contexts of reality by researchers on competence can be insightful for the researchers who are interested in measuring MI with effectiveness and efficiency. The theoretical integrating model of this study is expected to be useful for development of both streams of research on ‘competence’ and MI. Second, the results of reanalysis for measurement tools on MI, which has focusing also on measuring emotional aspects, indicate that the tools not only fail to meet the 'independence assumption' of the theory of MI, but also fall short to correspond in terms of the definitions of intelligences and components of measurement. In order to find definitions of intelligences and components that meet the domain-specific assumptions of MI, ‘uniqueness’ of each intelligence was identified, following the system of symbols and contents in the literature by H. Gardner. The findings from reanalysis of MI component will shed light on the development of measurement tools for MI; furthermore, they can be helpful for validation studies on domain-specificity of MI. },

  abstract={ Mandelate racemase from Pseudomonas putida catalyzes the Mg(2+)-dependent 1, 1-proton transfer that interconverts the enantiomers of mandelate. Residues of the 20s and 50s loops determine, in part, the topology and polarity of the active site and hence the substrate specificity. Previously, we proposed that, during racemization. the phenyl ring,c, of mandelate moves between an S-pocket comprised of residues from the 50s loop and an R-pocket comprised of residues from the 20s loop [Siddiqi, F., Bourque, J. R., Jiang, H., Gardner, M., St. Maurice, M., Blouin, C., and Bearne, S. L. (2005) Biochemistry 44, 90139021]. The 20s loop constitutes a mobile beta-meander flap that covers the active site cavity shielding it from solvent and controlling entry and egress of ligands. To understand the role of the 20s loop in catalysis and substrate specificity, we constructed a series of mutants (V22A, V22I, V22F, T24S, A25V, V26A, V26L. V26F, V29A, V29L, V29F, V26A/V29L, and V22I/V29L) in which the sizes of hydrophobic side chains of the loop residues were varied. Catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(m),,) for all mutants were reduced between 6- and 40-fold with the exception of those of V221, V26A, V29L, and V22I/V29L which had near wildtype efficiencies with mandelate. Thr 24 and Ala 25, located at the tip of the 20s loop, were particularly sensitive to minor alterations in the size of their hydrophobic side chains; however, most mutations were tolerated quite well, suggesting that flap mobility could compensate for increases in the steric bulk of hydrophobic side chains. With the exception of V29L, with mandelate as the substrate, and V22F and V26A/V29L. with 2-naphthylglycolate (2-NG) as the substrate, the values of k(cat) and K(m) were not altered in a manner consistent with steric obstruction of the R-pocket, perhaps due to flap mobility compensating for the increased size of the hydrophobic side chains. Surprisingly, V22I and V29L catalyzed the racemization of the bulkier substrate 2-NG with k(cat)/K(m) values similar to 2-fold greater than those observed for wild-type mandelate racemase. Although minor changes in substrate specificity were achieved through alterations of the active site flap of mandelate racemase, our results suggest that hydrophobic residues that reside on a flexible flap and define the topology of an active site through their van der Waals contacts with the substrate are quite tolerant of a variety of steric substitutions. },

  abstract={ (Background and Purpose) In modern society, small private educational spaces for children are artificially composed, and the development of space intelligence among children is limited in such spaces. In urban environments, nature has disappeared, and children are educated with the limited exposure to the elements of natural shapes. Such non-natural spaces are not suitable for children. To substitute for the absence of natural shapes in educational spaces for children in modern society with limitations of time, space, and distance, children were exposed to VR images containing elements of natural shapes. Thus, this study aims to suggest a theoretical background regarding an environment where the development of space intelligence among children is formed by researching the effects of experience with a VR visual environment on the development of space intelligence during a specific period of childhood. It also aimed to facilitate to the development of space intelligence with the use of VR experiences among children in modern society who are less exposed to elements of natural shapes. (Methods) This study examined whether the space intelligence of children during a specific period of childhood is developed through exposure to elements of natural shapes in VR. According to Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences, children's intelligence includes intelligence regarding space and the natural environment. According to Montessori and Piaget, there is a time when the development of space intelligence for children is maximized. Understanding the system and structure of nature in accordance with structure as an element of natural shapes, it was supposed that the space perceptual ability of children in a specific developmental period would be developed through observation of the structure and laws of natural shapes. The development of space intelligence among children is facilitated by realizing images with elements of natural shapes in VR. As current VR technology cannot accord with humans' somesthetic sensibility, among humans' senses, the visual experience was focused on. (Results) Regarding the period in which the development of space intelligence is activated, Piaget considered it to occur at 7-11 years old during the concrete operational stage, and Montessori considered it to occur at 8-12 years old during stage 2. Based on this, subjects of 6-12 years old were used. To measure space development ability, the projective space concept was differentiated from the topological space concept. Referring to previous studies, drawing figures were used to measure the projective space, and to measure the topological space, the 3-dimensional image experiment that Piaget used to measure space development was employed. The spatial development between children who viewed the VR images containing elements of natural shapes and children who did not view them was compared. Among 80 children of 8-12 years old from a small-sized private institute, 40 were assigned to a group that viewed the VR images containing elements of natural shapes, and 40 were assigned to a group that did not view them. They were then asked to solve questions for evaluating space intelligence in a questionnaire. (Conclusions) According to the results of the experiment, the children who viewed the VR images containing elements of natural shapes had higher space perceptual ability than the children who did not. The space intelligence of children in a specific period was developed through exposure to VR images containing elements of natural shapes. Thus, children residing in cities of modern society with limited development of their space intelligence owing to the absence of nature could improve their space intelligence by experiencing VR images containing elements of natural shapes. },

This study seeks to identify the level of global self-esteem, recognize the emotional regulation strategy used and the relationship between global self-esteem and emotional regulation strategies in 37 Gifted students participants in a Chilean extracurricular enrichment program. To this effect, the Piers-Harris Self-Concept Scale for children and young people, in Gorostegui’s version, and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire for children and adolescents (ERQ-CA), version revised by Gullone and Taffe (2012) are used. A descriptive analysis and a correlation analysis of variables are carried out, revealing that these students have adequate levels of global self-esteem, mostly use cognitive reassessment as an emotional regulation strategy, and there is a statistically significant negative correlation between global self-esteem and expressive suppression. This study becomes a contribution to the knowledge of socio-affective qualities of Gifted students and highlights the relevance of creating educational spaces focused on the satisfaction of their needs in a comprehensive and systematic manner. },

  abstract={ Lent and Brown (2006) suggest guidelines for creating and adapting assessment tools based on the Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT -Lent, Brown, & Hackett, 1994). In the last years, this theory has been the subject of substantial research, both basic and theoretical. The authors indicate that any assessment of SCCT should: (a) contextualize measures to make sure they are grounded in a particular, domain-specific context, (b) be reasonably comprehensive in sampling the domain, designing multifaceted measures when the criterion is correspondingly complex, and (c) ensure compatibility between predictors and criteria along key dimensions, including content, context, temporal orientation, and level of specificity. Additionally, it is important to use reliable and valid tests. Without sound measures, it is difficult, if not impossible, to establish whether theory-discrepant findings are attributable to problems with the theory, flaws in operationalizing it, or both. In Argentina, Cupani and Gnavi (2007) assessed a model of academic performance in Mathematic, based on the SCCT. Cupani and Gnavi adapted the subscales for Mathematic Outcome Expectancies and Performance Goals of the Middle School Self-Efficacy Scale (Fouad, Smith, & Enochs, 1997). Results indicated that the goals subscale has a simple factor structure with adequate internal consistence, although it did not predict academic performance in Mathematic. Moreover, the Subscale for Mathematics Outcome Expectancies showed low internal consistence and some of its items did not transfer well to our cultural setting. Therefore, two follow-up studies were carried out to improve the psychometric properties of both scales. The first study employed two focus groups (n per group = 8) and aimed at generating ideas on the student's expectations of results and goals on academic achievement in our cultural setting. The information gathered was used to write 7 new items for the goals subscale and 12 items for the outcome expectancies. These items were then tested for clarity and understanding in a sample of adolescents. Language corrections were also carried out, yielding two new goals and outcome expectancies scales (11 and 13 items, respectively). On the second study, these scales were administered to a sample of 420 adolescents (M = 13.84; SD = .76). The internal structure of the scales was examined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and their internal consistency was analyzed by Cronbach's alpha. The predictive validity for Academic Achievement in Mathematic was also analyzed. The scale of logical-mathematical self- efficacy from the (revised) Self-efficacy Inventory of Multiple Intelligences (Pérez & Cupani, 2008) was also administered. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that a single-factor structure for the scale of performance goals (GFI: .92; CFI: .95, RMSEA: .08) and for the Scale for Mathematic Outcome Expectancies (GFI: .95; CFI: .96, RMSEA: .06) is the most appropriate model for the data gathered. Both scales had optimal Cronbach's alpha values (.86 and. 85, for performance goals and outcome expectancies, respectively). The study on predictive validity also showed that logic-mathematic self- efficacy beliefs and achievement goals in Mathematic explain 32% of variance of math school performance. The results show that Academic Achievement in Mathematic is partially explained by the model. In summary, both scales allow a contextualized measurement of outcome expectancies and performance goals on Mathematic in teenagers from our cultural area. These scales have satisfactory psychometric properties, presenting a clear internal structure, and adequate internal consistence. Future application of path analysis will allow a more precise identification of the interrelations between outcome expectancies and performance goals on Mathematic and their direct and indirect effects upon academic achievement in it. },

  abstract={ The study of intelligence must be approached through a retrospective view allowing it to be defined within the evolution of human thought. Three historical stages may be established: Empirical: it includes the ability of a person tu use his/her capacity in order to cope with the challenges of daily life; this is merely empiric and associated with the cultural environment of the group. Psychometric: it was defined at the end of the XIX century. Works like those of Galton, in 1877, who was the creator of the concept of correlation with which one could associate several psychological variables in terms of the individual differences, are highlighted. Pearson formalized the theory of correlation and permited, therefore, the prediction of psychological variables based on the knowledge of others. In 1904 Spearman made a significant contribution to the use of the method of correlation when the theory of the two factors of intelligence, general and specific, was published. Binet developed the concept of IQ and Catell developed the First test of intelligence based on 50 subtests of sensorial capacities. Multiple Intelligences: Guilford, in 1936 and Thurstone in 1946 sustained the existence of several factors or components of intelligence, and were first to approach the concept of multiple intelligence. Thorndike sustained that the quantitative measurement of intelligence involved several types of approaches, the abstract or verbal, the empirical and the social. At the beginning of the 70's Gardner sustained the thesis of the existence of a mental structure with multiple intelligence, mentioning seven different types. Intelligence has been conceptualized as an individual's overall ability to act rationally and successfully. However, it has been noted that a high intelligence quotient (IQ) is by no means a warranty leading to achieve prosperity, prestige, and success in life. This has brought about the classical intelligence construct being put into question. And also has lead to propose that there is not only a single form of intelligence but that there are several different types. This, in turn, has lead to re-categorize intelligence into a construct called emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is a construct which takes into account the individual's ability to monitor his/her own feelings and emotions and those of others, in order to discriminate between them and use this information as a guide for thoughts and actions. The evaluation of this construct poses a great difficulty because, even though there are some paradigmatic and scalar approaches, these are mainly directed towards work environment and used by organizational development advisors. In addition, the scales being used are short ones with a low validity content. Presently, there are no scalar instruments available in Mexico, to measure emotional intelligence. It was determined that our instrument will present a format of inventory, items formed by a statement that represents a feature of paradigmatic behavior of the emotional intelligence, with options to answer true or false. The inventory is formed by independent scale, which as a whole form a profile. The content of the instrument is based on three sources: The emotional abilities described by Gardner which are: capacity to cultivate relationships and maintain friendships, capacity to solve conflicts and dexterity for social analysis. The second source is described by Salovey: capacity to know and manage own emotions, to recognize emotions in others, and to manage interpersonal relationships.And finally, in the third place, we used the factors of the International Association for the Emotional Applied Intelligence. These include emotional control, self-esteem, control of impulses, handling of stress, social ability, handling of goals, automotivation and positive attitudes. The instrument which has been developed allows for emotional intelligence to be measured in eight scales in order to render a profile: impulse inhibition, empathy, optimism, social skills, emotional expression, achievement acknowledgement, self-esteem, and kindness. A non-probabilistic sample was used in a two-stage procedure including 723 individuals, between 16-80 years, where 49% of them were mates and 50.8% females. Individuals involved gave their consent for the instrument to be applied. A validation and reliability procedure was carried out. The profile reached an alpha=0.95 internal consistency quotient. The eight aspects calculated by means of the factor analysis, through the main component method, and confirmed by structural analysis account for the 47.8% of common variance. The model was evaluated through a linear structural analysis using the AMOS V6.3 program. The following criteria were reached: X-2(16) = 93.95; p<0.001, adjustment general fit index was AGFI=93% and root minimum square error adjusted was R-MSEA=0.08. These values show a good adjustment. Another inter-scalar structural analysis considered impulse inhibition as the main scale in people's emotional intelligence. It was concluded that the Emotional Intelligence Profile was valid and reliable. Structural analysis carried out between profile scales shows a plausible pattern of QE previous and consequent features for emotional intelligence. The model obtained is non-recursive, this means that it presents closed trajectories. In other words, variables taken into account in evaluating the emotional intelligence construct feedback and potencialize one another. Each subscale refers to: a) Impulse inhibition: the ability that a person has to control impulsivity and to delay reinforcement; besides, it also is the ability to shift emotional states according with environment; b) Empathy, or the ability to identify self emotions and the feelings of others, and therefore to attain emotional agreement; c) Optimism, this is the positive attitude towards daily life, and it covers cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects; d) Social skills, this means the ability to learn new behaviors to adapt to the environment and to discriminate certain behaviors in specific situations, with the aim of adapting to society; e) Emotional expression, this is the ability to express emotional states in adequate situations; f) Achievement's acknowledgement, it's the cognitive ability to accept personal success and own well being, obtained along life; g) Self-esteem, in the traditional concept; it's the cognitive and emotional reasoning about self, from a critical angle; h) Kindness, it's a new construct which means the attitude of a person in the sense of preserving the well-being of others. The emotional intelligence profile will allow to study this concept considering several hypothesis, and, if it happens to be the case, to find specific profiles for different groups, mainly those characterized by mental health disturbances. },
